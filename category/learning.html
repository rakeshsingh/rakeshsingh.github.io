<p>So this is that day of month again. Your paycheck is on the door and you have already made so many plans on how to spend it. You have to watch this new Marvel hollywood movie that is releasing this weekend. Or you had to buy those additional pair of shoes. Or just need to go to this fancy new restaurent for dinner with your date. Well, I would like to have a moment of thought before you do any of these, by understanding how much money you really earn, and how much money you can really spend. Lets do a little discussion here. </p>
<p>Lets figure out how much you earn, and how much you can really spend without impacting something or other.</p>                </article>
