<p>How would you feel when you reach at the top of the Mount Everest and to record your feat you search for your camera to take the snap of this moment and ahhhhh you forgot your camera at your home ... </p><p> How would you feel when you appear on some television show, and everyone  misses you because there is a India Pakistan cricket match coming on the same day...</p><p>Hmm, I am not the guy who was in above those situations... but I can ceartainly sympathise with them... because I have been to similar cicumastances exactly a couple of times....</p><p> The first one was a little long ago, when I was in Delhi preparing for IIT JEE [wasnt even aware of some better options like IIIT :) ] .. so it was morning of 31st December... we were walking near the Delhi Gate... and somebody took snap of our group ... to put it on the cover of The Hindustan Times....</p><p>Isnt it great to be on the front page of Delhi edition of Hindustan times on 01/01/01 in a photo with background of Delhi Gate and lots of Pigeon flying around you :) ..... but here is the tragedy... One of those pigeons was kind of lazy and instead of flying high... he was flying near our heads and ... and managed to come in front of my face just at the same time when the photographer clicked his camera  :(( </p><p>So here I was on the front page of one of the leading national dailies on 01/01/01 but still I cant prove that its me .. </p><p>[still searching for that pic to post here]</p><p>something similar to this happened yesterday... </p><p>I am a wordpress user and I was facing troubles with the comments section... so I went to www.wordpress.com to see if there is some news or any info regarding this... and guess what... our posts [Mine Kunal's] were there on the front page of the wordpress.com ... </p><p>but again there was this problem ... our posts were there .. but with no link to our blogs.. or actual posts ... so nobody knew those were actually our posts :(</p><p>But this time I have proofs in black and white... hmmm, in screenshots actually... <br /></p><p>This first photo shows kunal's post along with some other post.. notice the "wordpress.com" in the address bar... actual post can be found at http://kunal.wordpress.com/2005/09/12/monday/</p><p> <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com//?attachment_id=124" title="Mine and Kunal's post "><br /></a><a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com//?attachment_id=125" title="Kunal's post">		 		<img width="128" height="96" src="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/thumb-wordpress-5.JPG" alt="Kunal" /></a></p><br /><p> <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com//?attachment_id=124" title="Mine and Kunal's post ">		 		<br /></a></p><p>My post.. actual URL http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2005/09/17/weekly-updates-my-end/</p><p> <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com//?attachment_id=123" title="my post">		 		<img width="128" height="96" src="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/thumb-wordpress-3.JPG" alt="my post" /></a></p><p>Mine and kunal's  post </p><p>Actual Urls: </p><p>http://kunal.wordpress.com/2005/09/20/murphy/ and http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2005/09/20/the-one-with-the-ice-cream/</p><p>Â </p><p> <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com//?attachment_id=122" title="Mine and Kunal's post ">		 		<img width="128" height="96" src="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/thumb-wordpress-2.JPG" alt="Mine and Kunal" /></a></p><p>Kunal's Post</p><p>actual URL: http://kunal.wordpress.com/2005/09/27/hyderabad-still-rocks/<br /> </p><p> <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com//?attachment_id=121" title="Kunal's post">		 		<img width="128" height="96" src="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/thumb-wordpress-1.JPG" alt="Kunal" /></a></p><p>My Post</p><p>actual url: http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2005/09/11/my-dil-goes-mmmmm/ </p><p> <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com//?attachment_id=123" title="my post">		 		</a></p><div> <div>  <div> 	 	<a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2005/11/18/a-close-call-to-fame/my-post/" title="my post">		 		<img width="128" height="96" src="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/thumb-wordpress-61.JPG" alt="my post" /> 	</a> </div><br /></div> </div><p><a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com//?attachment_id=123" title="my post"> 	so guys believe it or not, we ruled on the wordpress.com yesterday :)</a></p>
