Sometimes you feel that a particular song is made for you. It just fits with the mood and you go on humming it again and again ... For the last few days I am feeling same about the song "Sitting on the dock of Bay" by Ottis Redding ... anyway the keyword is not "sitting" but "careless" as I wrote in the subject line...  So, on last wednesday, I got inspired from the song ... and thought to waste some time... and just a few minutes later I realized that I am not wasting my time .. I am spending my time with myself ... well, it might look like fattebazi but its true ... I dont know about others but I seem to spend very little time when I am completely myself ...   ...while coming back to my residence I decided to board off the auto, some 2 kms away from home, and started walking... it resulted in some realisations ...   first of all our approach towards life has become very mechanical .. we arent living Life anymore .. we are following a routine... its like we are programmed for everyday ... from monday to friday .. wake up early in the morning .. go to office .. do some coding/debugging/surfing/chatting... come home tired in the evening, with no mood/condition for any creativity... we finally end up in our bed, hoping to rise early in the morning to go for office??  Is this what we work for??  I dont know what other people have plans for their life, but till recently I just wanted to be in a good company and keep climbing the ladder slowly and steadily towards the top.. I still want to do that.. but I want to know the price which I am going to pay for that...  Well, it all seems very confusing for the time being ... may be its time for another walk :)...
