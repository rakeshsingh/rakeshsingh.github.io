Two software engineer friends.. now distanced by time and place... communicate mainly on IM and occassionally on phone... with every coming day, each one of them starts getting busy in their own world, with lesser and lesser common topics to chat on...

One fine day they meet on gTalk, and here is their conversation...
<blockquote>SE1: "Dude! whats up !!"

SE2: "Oh, I am great, whats up with you ?"

SE1: "Yeah me too, doing good..."

SE1: "Kaam, waam sahi chal raha hai"

SE2: "Yeah, its good"

SE2: "And how is life"

SE1: "Never been better :)"

---this followes by a pause, both of the get back to there work for a few seconds            ---

--- hoping that other guy will write something, SE1 thinks to break the ice &                   ---

--- starts fiddling   with what to write... but is not able to think anything                         ---

So he just starts typing: "Aur sunao.... " only to see that IM window is already flashing with a new message from SE2, and it reads.....

SE2: "Aur Sunao, Kya chal raha hai..."</blockquote>
Isn't it common to most of us.. It has become such a natural phenomenon, whenever we dont have anything to say, we just pass the ball to other court, and the standard question is almost everytime just a variant of "Aur sunao ?"

This "Aur sunao", actually means that tell me something which I dont know about you or tell me something which I know about you but don't want to ask.

Like:
<ul>
	<li> How is your love-life?</li>
	<li>Whats the name of your latest girl friend?</li>
	<li>How was the last appraisal?</li>
	<li>When are you planning to change your job?</li>
	<li>When are you becoming a graduate?</li>
	<li>When are you getting married?</li>
	<li>How is the progress in your startup?</li>
</ul>
In short, lets catchup buddy and tell me how is life treating you?

So everyone out there, friends, classmates, seniors, juniors, visitors to this blog; whoever is reading this post:

<strong>"Aur sunao, kya chal raha hai ?"</strong>
