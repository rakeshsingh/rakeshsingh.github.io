<font color="red">[For my batchmates only ]</font>

While the blogs of most of my batchmates are filled with posts of nostalgia, how can I stay behind. After all I am one of the guys who has added fuel to this fire [I guess wrong phrase for this situation .. something like adding tear to the sadness would be more appropriate :) ] with my senti mails. 

Well, the leaders will always be Nirnimesh and Jayram who converted themselves in some sort of coundown bot with every  morning  spreading this news that only So and so days are left [I guess its 2 more days to go now... if the exams shedule was taken into consideration ]. Nirnimesh, hit us with a big blow when he sent a mail saying that the days of being student are over and we have to get used to the word alumni and start using the ug2k1_AT_students.iiit.net instead of ug4_AT_students.iiit.net. Sometimes truths are so bitter, %^$& you all for realizing me that.

This place was more than a home for last 4 years and I'll really miss all the moments spent here with all the near and dear friends. After IIIT I will have to fight for a new identity. Here I was safely part of a community. One of the 200101*** and 200102*** s having a surname of students.iiit.net now we all are getting married to our companies or Institutes to get surnames of the form we@XYZ.com :) 

My nostalgia deepened when I listened to this song.. "babul mora naihar chuto jaye". This song has two meanings. It can be looked upon and a song by "atma that is leaving its body" and a song by "a bride who is leaving her dad's home". I never really felt the pain hidden in this song until today.. can't able to write what I am really feeling right now.. 

 just want to say that, I'll miss you guys
