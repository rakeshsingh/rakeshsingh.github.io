The better half of my blog audience [<a href="http://students.iiit.ac.in">read IIITians</a>] already know what a barcamp is so this post is mainly for the other half [well, who said that I can have only one better half ;) ]

<b>What is a barcamp?</b>

Well they should have named this as NoBar-Camp, as it is an answer to the Un-conference of Tim's : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foocamp">FooCamp,</a> where the techies come together and share their knowledge on the topics of their choice; with less restrictions to make it reach to a wider audience.

To know more about it read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcamp">wikipedia article on barcamp.</a>
