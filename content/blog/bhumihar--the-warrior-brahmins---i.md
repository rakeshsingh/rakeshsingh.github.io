Day: Basant Panchami

Occasion: Its Saraswati Pooja in my School
Scene: I am sitting on Pooja as <em>Yajman</em> with the Panditji [was a standard 6th student at that time].

Panditji:

<strong><em>"Om Vishnurvishnurvishnuhu, Adya Brahmano nhi Dwiteeyaparardhe Shrishwetawarahakalpe Vaiwaswatmanwantare shtawinshatitame Kaliyuge Kaliprathamcharane Jambudweepe Bharatkhande, Bharatvarshe <font color="red">Palojori</font></em> Sthane Namsamwatsare rutau Mase Pakshe Tithau Dine Prataha Kale..."</strong>

Panditji: [to me] Yajmaan, gotra bataiye.

Me: Ji, mujhe nahi pata. Papaji mera gotra kya hai [Papa was watching this ceremony]

Papa: Vishnuvridhi

Panditji: thik hai .. and then he went on like

<strong><font color="red">Vishnuvridhi</font> Gotrotpannaha Sharma/Verma/Gupto aham, Shrutismrutipurana uktafal praptipoorvakam Shribhagwatpreetyartham cha Prataha (Madhyane,Sayam) Snanam Karishye"</strong>

<strong>Ashwakrante Rathkrante Vishnukante Wasundhare|
Mrittike ! Har Me PapamYanmaya Dushkritam Kritam||</strong>

<strong>Nandinee Nalini Sita Malati cha Mahapaga |
Vishnupadabjasambhuta Ganga Tripathgamini ||</strong>

<strong>Bhagirathi Bhogwati Janhawi Tridasheshwari |
Dwadshaitani Namani YatraYatra Jalashaye ||
Snanodyataha Smarennityam Tatra Tatra Vasamyaham ||</strong>

Later in the day I asked Papa, what is this Gotra. He explained me saying that we are Chitapavan Brahmins, having Vishnuvridhi Gotra and are commonly known as Bhumihar Brahmins or Babhans.

That was my first encounter with the word Bhumihaar, and it was like;  so I am Bhumihaar, whats a big deal.

As the days went, I came to know more and more about this word. How at certain places its a matter of pride to say that you are a Bhumihaar yet the same time there are places where you shouldnt even disclose the fact that you are one.

I have seen quotes like <strong>"If you see a Bhumihaar and a Cobra, Kill the Bhumihaar first, Because they are more dangerous than Cobra"</strong> and also listened to the Slogans like <strong>"Bhura Baal Saf karo"</strong>, one of the most famous slogans of Laloo era, where Bhura Baal, stands for Bhumihar, Rajput, Brahmin and Lala (Kayasth).. Well that is politics, never cared more about it, but if you are a Bihari or a Jharkhandi, you can understand the importance of caste based based vote banks in politics.

Anyway, this is not what I am going to write about, in this post.

I know that I  am a brahmin that is by definition I am <em> "the one who has realised or attempts to realise</em> <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman" title="Brahman">Brahman</a>" (ब�?रह�?म)".</em> But how can I attempt to realise the <em>Brahaman </em>when I dont know about <em>Brahmin </em>itself.

This curiousity to know the Brahmins, especially the Bhumihar brahmins has made me to search and explore the web for the detailed information, in the upcoming posts I will try to write whatever I have collected so far.
