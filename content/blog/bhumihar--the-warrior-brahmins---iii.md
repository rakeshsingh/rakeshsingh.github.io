<strong>Gotra and Surnames</strong>

Gotra literally means "Cow-Pen" or "Cow-Shed". All the families sharing a common cow-pen (where you kept cattle during the night) were generally from a same extended family and hence marriage among them was strictly forbidden.

Gotra's are like the clans of Irish people. In the days gone by, Gotra was the basis of deciding matrimonial alliances. In order to avoid inbreeding, persons from the same clan or Gotra were forbidden to marry. In addition to this there were certain other rules also.

There are fourteen main Gotra's of Chitpavan brahmins, they are :

1.  Atri
2. Bhabravya
3. Bharadwaj
4. Gargya
5. Jamadagni

8. Koundinya
9. Koushik
10. Nityundan
11. Shandilya
12. Vasishtha
13. Vatsa
14. Vishnuvruddha
