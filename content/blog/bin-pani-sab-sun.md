I always had pride over two things ... first the power supply in IIIT [I never saw a running fan getting stopped because of a power cut ] and the abundance of rain in my home town... 

It used to rain whenever I went home .. be it winter or summer or any month of the calendar.. but this time it was too much .. I stayed there for two months and the water clouds were nowhere to be seen.. yeah It did rain once or twice but it was hardly of any use... the mercury was sleeping soundly in between 47-49 to make the situation more worse... I read in the newspapers that this was the highest temperature recorded in the regiion, in the last 60 years. 

Well, this has created a big shortage of drinking water. Thankfully the situation in my home is still very good. The ground water level is still very high... but the situation is not that rosy everywhere ... just 10kms away from my home, the water level has gone down to several hundred feets... The shortage of water is now heavily  being felt in India and the common men have come on road to demand drining water.


Coming to some stats ... more than 75% of this earth has covered by water ... but only 3% of this water is consumable... of this 3%, 2% is frozen in glaciers, from the remaining 1% half is stored  in clouds which is what we see in the form of rain... the remaining half percent is what we have as underground water which is available for us ... 

If the current trend continues, ground water will also not be available after a decade or so. I read at another place, where the author was saying that probably the third world war will be faught for water. Right now there are 268 rivers which are flowinig across different nations and if  "Kaveri river issue" is any indication than his statement doesn't look like an exaggeration... 

Well, the time has come when we should try to understand the actual value of natural resources and start using them wisely... 

Isi sandarbh main bachpan main padha ek doha yad aa raha hai...

"Rahiman pani rakhiye, bin pani sab soon! "
"Pani Bina na ubare, Moti, Manush, Choon !!"
