When I started blogging in July 2004, with a <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2004/07/05/test/">test post</a>, I didnt have any particular reason in mind and If anybody would have asked me "Why Do you Blog ?"  my answer would have been "Why I should not !!".

With time, blogging for me has turned from being just an interest, to a hobby, then to a passion and now it has become a part of my life. At times I really feel that will it be possible for me to stop blogging ?
Despite so many changes, there are certain things which are still same. I always used to write crap and still do it :) but there is one-thing with which probably every blogger will agree that not matter how crappy you write or used to write, whenever you go back and read your old posts it  makes you feel good.

In my batch, there was a period, where some 20 or 30 someone of my classmates used to write blogs with  people like <a href="http://blog.smr.co.in">Sunil</a>, <a href="http://jayaram.wordpress.com">Jayaram</a>, <a href="http://utkarshkhare.wordpress.com">Utkash </a>and <a href="http://sanyams.spaces.msn.com">Sanyam </a>leading from the front followed by people like me, <a href="http://kunal.wordpress.com">Kunal</a>, <a href="http://srjth.blogspot.com">Sreejith</a>, <a href="http://bookophobic.blogspot.com">Imran</a>, <a href="http://nirnimesh.blogspot.com">Nirnimesh</a>, <a href="http://vardhaman.wordpress.com">Vardhman</a>, <a href="http://ramneekgrover.blogspot.com">Ramneek</a>, <a href="http://research.iiit.ac.in/~paresh/cgi-bin/blog/blosxom.cgi">Paresh</a>, <a href="http://adityamaheshwari.blogspot.com">Aditya</a>, <a href="http://tarunjain.wordpress.com">Tarun</a>, <a href="http://sandeepchandna.blogspot.com">Sandeep</a>, <a href="http://madhukar.wordpress.com">Madhukar</a>, Girish, <a href="http://beerla.blogspot.com">Bolero</a>, <a href="http://whatshouldichoose.wordpress.com/">Ravichandra</a>, <a href="http://r-a-v-i.blogspot.com/">Ravishankar</a>, Niruapam, <a href="http://parida.blogspot.com">Parida</a>, <a href="http://anandabhi.blogspot.com">Anand</a>,<a href="http://vindodgupta.blogspot.com">Gupta </a>and some occassional posts from <a href="http://puspendra.blogspot.com/">Puspendra</a>, <a href="http://jpiyush.blogspot.com/">PJ</a>, <a href="http://majjj.blogspot.com/">Majj </a>and <a href="http://frustooo.blogspot.com/">Amal </a>as well. [remind me, if I forgot to mention anyone's name]

It wasn't just personal blogs, blogging as a passion and hobby was increasing so rapidly that some of us created <a href="http://p4runs.blogspot.com">our college group blog</a> and ofcourse the <a href="http://gdit2k1.blogspot.com">Gdit2k1 Batch Blog</a>, and in recent times a collaborative blog <a href="http://stardotstar.wordpress.com">Star-Dot-Star</a>.

Seeing this popularity of blogs, our class girls too came with a nasty blog named as gdit2k1 girls blog or something like that to do some online leg-pulling. [Is that blog still alive ??]

Those were the golden periods of blogging.

And the current state is : Jayaram has long left writing. Ranta has One post in last two months, Ramneek, Imran, Paresh, Aditya, Tarun, Girish, Bolero no longer blog.

Sandeep, Utkarsh, Sreejith, Sanyam are still blogging but very infrequently. When Sreejith started blogging his blog title used to be "One For The Day" and now it has changed into "Once In A While", I just hope that it won't turn into something like "On Leave For A While" .

For past one year or so Kunal has been my blog buddy, we used to discuss the new blogging trends, technologies, blog templates, what comments he got or I got and things like that. My posts always used to had his as the first comment and I too tried to do the same. There were times when he used to think to make a career switch to online-journalism and he even tried to do so with his sports blog.

But today he is saying that he is <a href="http://kunal.wordpress.com/2006/08/29/break/">taking a break.</a>

I don't know what will I look forward to when I will open my Google Reader Tomorrow.

About me !! I guess, I will keep boring my blog audience with my day-to-day blabbering but  its a sincere request to all the names mentioned in this blog that you take a break or write "Once In a While", do whatever you like to do,  but just dont stop blogging.

Dudes ! Please Blog On.
