According to the <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index/tekst.htm">TIOBE Programming Community Index for April 2005</a> C++ is no longer in top 3 most popular programming languages. Interesting my favorite language Perl is the the one which has dethroned C++ to get its position.

I think <a href="http://research.iiit.ac.in/~paresh/cgi-bin/blog/blosxom.cgi">Parry</a> will jump with <a href="http://research.iiit.ac.in/~vidit/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi">Joy</a> after hearing this news.
