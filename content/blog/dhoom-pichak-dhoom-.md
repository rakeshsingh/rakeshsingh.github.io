Attended Microsft IDC's 8th anniversay last saturday.

It was grand in every sense. Beautiful ambience, great food, delicious desserts, plenty of liquor, wonderful internal performance, great show by Euphoria and beautiful girls in attractive clothes ;) what more you would want in one evening !!

The newly built convention center in Hitex is really worth a visit, the interior of the convention hall is really something to watch for.

The performance by Euphoria was the life of the evening. Palash has got a magical voice and is a great entertainer & Hitesh just rocked on Guitar. The entire band were <i>just so</i> ... and they '<i>Dhoom</i>'ed  us throughout their performance.
