Just noticed these two cool apps released by <a href="http://labs.digg.com">digg labs. </a>

<a href="http://labs.digg.com/stack/">Digg Stack</a>
<blockquote>Digg Stack shows diggs occuring in real time on up to 100 stories at once. Diggers fall from above and stack up on popular stories. Brightly colored stories have more diggs.</blockquote>

and <a href="http://labs.digg.com/swarm/">Digg Swarm</a>
<blockquote>Digg Swarm draws a circle for stories as they're dugg. Diggers swarm around stories, and make them grow. Brightly colored stories have more diggs.</blockquote>
