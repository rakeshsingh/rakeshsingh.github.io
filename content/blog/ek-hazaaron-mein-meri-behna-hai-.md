Phoolon ka Taaron ka, Sabka Kehna Hai.
Ek Hazaaron main, meri Behna hai.

Another Raksha Bandhan is knocking on the door and I am away from my Didi... missing her and listening to Rakhi Songs...

In this new millenium (since year 2001) we  havent been together for Rakhi ... Every year I make up my mind that I will get time off for Raksha Bandhan .. but somehow I forget at the end...and only when she reminds me that whether or not I have got the Rakhis sent by her, I wake up again and curse myself. But another year comes and I repeat the same mistake..

Somehow, these sisters are more caring and concerned then their brothers... They are so excited about this festival ... My Didi is also very same .. when I was in home ... she used to prepare for Rakhi for 2-3 days well in advance ... My task was to get the things from bazaar ... and she always used to be like

"Roli .. aur Mauli lana nahi bhoolna.."
"Motichoor ke Laddoo hone chahiye..., Doosri Mithayi Laye to Pitoongi"
"Akshat aur Dahi hona chahiye ... halwai se bol jana subah subah dahi de jaye"

but she never asked me to get Rakhis, it was always her responsiblity .. all these years I never really saw her going out for shopping Rakhis... but she always had these beautiful Rakhi on the Raksha Bandhan Day.

In childhood I used to hate the day of Raksha Bandhan .. as we needed to get up early in the morning and  take a bath ... and we used to remain on fast until Didi tied the Rakhi...

But didi was very strict about it... so we didnt used to have much option.

Around 6 she used to wake us ..

"Utho .. jake nahao abhi" .. "Rajesh tum Pahle.. Aur fir Rakesh"
"Aur dono naye kapde pahanana, purane nahi"

After that she used to do some pooja and after that.. she used to apply this Tika on our forehead (made of Akshat, Roli and Dahi).. and then finally used to tie the Rakhi.. which was followed by offering Mothichoor ka laddoo...Now this was my favorite part ...eating motichoor ka ladoo... with her hands..

With time ..we all grew up.. and are now seperated by thousand miles ... But she is still very same... Come tomorrow .. she will ring me first at 6 am to wake me up ... then at 6:30 when I am all prepared.. but she will cross verify .. whether I have worn atleast clean clothes or not ... then ask me to tie the Rakhi myself :) .. and I am very much sure that she will be doing some pooja at her end .. praying for long and healthy lives of us...

Guess... however distant we are ... this bond wont get affected a little.. because Didi is there at the other end ... strengthening it everyday with her prayers and poojas...

Love you Didi and Miss you a lot ..
