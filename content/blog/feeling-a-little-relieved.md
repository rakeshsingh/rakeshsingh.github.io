ahh.. the last few days were the busiest days of my life .. but came very fruitful..
I felt the power of time .. how it makes one very sad at a momment and very next momemnt it makes the same person very happy ..
Well !! It was placement season ,(it's not yet over.. only the first round is done) ... I got placed in Oracle, a company where, I used to think that only geeks or toppers go .. but finally I am there...
... any way I am little relieved ... but these teacher will not let us enjoy our final year... it's our final year and they have imposed new rules..that we have to attend 85% of the classes ... wtf.. Is it a college or a jail.. any way only one year ... after that I'll be free...
