I am crossing the limits of utter laziness... I wanted to write about Felicity in last week itself ...
I kept postponing it .. and its 13th now... 7 days have gone and still no words for felicity in my blog...

You must be wondering why this sudden awakening!!! actually I was going through Thiyagarajan's <a href="http://thiyagarajan.blogspot.com">blog</a>
and found one post about our college rock band <a href="http://www.hindu.com/mp/2005/02/08/stories/2005020800780100.htm">Insomia</a>...
and I thought if he can still remain in touch with with the IIIT, why cant I??

Ok Coming back to Felicity... I was initially very worried about its fate... because of the way things were going on ... in the very beginning there
was a mild difference of opinions between the juniors themselves (which we had never seen before in IIIT), then the coming of Avik as Felicity 
co-cordinator ... which spoilt the mood of juniors... actually it always happens... the culfest is always believed to be a done entirely by the third 
years.. we faced similar things last year.. so this time we didn't disturb the 3rd years at all...  (well  another good execuse to hide our laziness :) )
and above all the Amalgam didn't took place...

One of the major reasons for cancellation of Amalgam were, we 4th years ourselves. We were pretty busy with our FYPs and test, but looking 
back into time... the same problems were there in the last year too. Our seniors also were busy with their FYPs and all but still they participated.
I think one reason could be lack of enthusiasm from the organisers side.. I still remember how we publicises the whole event last year... where 
every time one used to go to the students <a href="http://students.iiit.ac.in">site</a> , a pop up used to be there to challenge him/her saying --
come on guys take this challenge head on...
all those posters which we (especially utkarsh) used to paste every other week about <font color="red">Rohit and his love story</font>... 
to create the feeling of felicity...to remind students that something is round the corner... I never felt this way this year...
Well another reason could be the cultural council... even being a council made entirely from students and for the students.. it always seems to
maintain a distance from the students...

But as the Felicity started coming closer... things started becoming more clearer... juniors got some good sponsors like M$, Verizon and TCS to cover
the expeneses... I started feeling the same way like last year... thanks to the hand made posters of felicity, which were very very beautiful..
Thanx to the person who ever made that.. the idea and the efforts , everything was very extra-ordinary... If anyone reading this post has a 
pic of that plz tell me where can I get it ...

Coming to events... last year I didn't have the time to enjoy any event... I remember I was was so frustrated about this , that finally on
the eve of fusion nite I switched off my cell saying to hell with this management work... I need to see something .. I am going to watch atleast 
one event... and the Fusion Night was so perfect and so enchanting ,I never experienced anything like that .. not even the concert of 
Rehman and Lata Mangeshkar ... 

This time I wanted to participate in all the events... and finally participated in almost half of all the technical and cultural events...
I remember our junior girls commenting on us "in seniors ko kya ho gaya hai", well just one answer to all of them...
 "you will realize it next year !!"

The technical event started with Online programming contest.. which was a hit ... I think our programming contest is getting more and more 
respect every year. Sadly, this year our own participants didn't do that well... (Somebody plz kick Amal from my side )

The Online Treasure hunt (Cache In), was also well thought out.... nice set of questions.. we managed to join the top 5  teams to finally
reach to the treasure.

The online crossword and online quiz were also very interesting. Me, Jaya and Kunal didn't sleep properly for 3 consecutive nights to find 
the answers for the quiz. Satvik must have spent a lot of time preparing the time.. in making the question... I can never forget 
the last night, when Me and Jaya got frustrated with various meaningless keywords  to search in google. Well sincere efforts always pay back :)
and finally the other day me and jaya shared the  second spot together for  (in Jayaram's words ) "a Princely sum of 300 "each :))

There were many more interesting events like Biz Quiz, IT Quiz..etc 

The cultural events were also organized pretty well. we participated in Face Painting, Collage Making, Antakshari... and didn't get 
anything :)) ... anyway  as I always say, its not the results which matter, its the spirit and sincere efforts which matter.

The stage events were good.  The presentation and the management was very good but except the solo singing,  the lack of participation
was largely felt in all the events. 

The nights were good.. Bombay Vikings sang really well but I think we needed some person who could have put more enthu in the crowd
the only solution could be to have more then one celebrity in one night... well its not possible now... but may be after 4-5 years... 
I heard that performance of Debu Choudhary was good... I missed that.. I was very tired that day ... 
The fusion night was as expected the best program of the Felicity. 
 
The performance of our college band was mind blowing.. This band has surely travelled a long distance from the <font color="red"><b>
Check Check</b></font> of Shalabh (no offence itended)... Those times listening to Insomnia was a real pain in the neck... Thank God that we have much more talented guys/gals now... Well atleast Vidit will agree with me ..

Seems Mr and Ms Felicity has lost its touch over the time... and also we need to have some new ideas...there was nothing new in it.
The only good thing was that, our local lad Anand Rathi became the Mr Felicity.


This takes me to the results. This time our batch done pretty well. We were everywhere... Ketan got the first prize in Cache-In,
me and Jaya did well in Quiz, Piyush as usual did wonders with his songs, winning prizes in group songs. Girls of our batch got
first prize in the group folk dance. Parivesh got the second prize in instrumental... Pappu and co and Patnaik won the BizInfo.
Sam and team performed as usually very well... winning the prize in western group dance... in Debugging the C bug contest.. 
4 teams  of our batch were in the top 5... with Amal and Sunil leading the bandwagon... again  Bapu and Google and DP repeated 
the story in Java jargons.. 

This time all the events were managed pretty well... everything went very smoothly... all the technical events  and cultural events 
were well thought out and well planned... The only problem as I said earlier was lack of participation..... there could be many reasons
for this. May be the timing was not correct.. may be the publicity wasn't done properly... 
Last year the opposite has happened... we managed to pull the crowd... but the events were not that well managed... 
anyway whatever be the reasons... I hope the current second years will learn ... and do their best

At last.... 
Kudos to all the organizers for organizing every event flawlessly... well guys you are better managers than us :) ...
