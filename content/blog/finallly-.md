I compiled and installed the new kernel (2.6.10) on my system .. I was kind of ashamed that it is my 4th year and I haven't yet compiled the Linux kernel.
So today I woke up early in the morning at 8:30 (he he this is quiet early for me ) and came to the lab with this mission.
Though when I used the new kernel for the first time .. It came with a
little surprise that the X was not working .. but that was a minor hiccup because it was the problem with Nvidia driver .. I reinstalled it .. and everything seems working pretty well...
Well that's it now .. Have to read the wonderful world of Linux 2.6. U too can have a look <a href="http://www.kniggit.net/wwol26.html">here</a>
