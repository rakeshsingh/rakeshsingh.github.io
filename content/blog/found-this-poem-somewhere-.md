Come

come along with me
to the plateau in the black sky
with a thousand stars all bright
which melt with your gentle smiles

Come sweet angel
let's stand on this cloudy floor
where we don't need to close our eyes
in our place so high

Silence listens to our every breath
And with the morning sunrise
We'd have made a dream to try
