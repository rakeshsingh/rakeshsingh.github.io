This is cool ..there are around  some 40 days remaining for the final submission of the fyp ..but we haven't done any thing so far.
Today we had to submit the progress report. I was wondering what to write in this ... that for the past two months we have done everything except contributing anything to final year project.
What will I write, that I went to Shimla and we had a real gala time over there or we enjoyed rain dance in Ramoji or we ate chocolates in<strong> Majj's talk</strong> or the boating was fun in the class picnic.
Anyway, as we are very good in doing BC ; especially me and Utkarsh. So it didn't take us much time to finish the report. It was full of lies that we did this thing and that thing and some 90% of this module is complete and the only major work remaining is the integration part ;-) ..
Well this time even our project guide was a little reluctant in signing the progress report. But as usually we convinced him.

Well !! One thing is sure. Our final submission is going to be very tough. We will have to do so many things to save our face ...Ok tab ki tab dekhenge .. for now its party time  ...
