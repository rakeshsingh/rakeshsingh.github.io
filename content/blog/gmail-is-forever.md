One of the many reasons(Search being the topmost of them), why  I like <a href="https://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/wp-admin/www.google.com">Google</a> is because of <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/">gMail</a>. This email service has revolutionized the way the eMails used to work.. it hasnt  yet completed even the  2yrs of its existence but still its a way ahead of its competitors in terms of features.
Well, I am not going to blabber about the features of gMail here.. its just that this reality struck me in the morning... since the time I have started using gMail .. my identity on the parallel front has changed from rakesh_kumar[At]students.iiit.net to rakesh.kumar[At]ca.com to rakesh.ra.kumar[At]oracle.com .. but gMail is still there, giving me company as a  true friend, providing me a permanet address in the cyber space with kumar.rakesh[At]gmail.com

So, what about Yahoo! and MSN !! yeah I do exist as kumar.rakesh[At]hotmail.com and kumar.rakesh[At]yahoo.co.in .. but only for novelty.. just in the hope that maybe some day they will wake up and do something revolutionary.

Right not, for me they stand no where next to gMail. At present I have some 1.5 giga bytes in 14000 eMails  which includes some 50+ mp3s. I guess no other service provider can give me so much storage space with an equally good searching and indexing service.
Well, they say nothing is permanent in the world wide web, but for the time being I would like to say that gMail is forever for me.

:-) can you see that previeous sentence in itself is an oxymoron.
