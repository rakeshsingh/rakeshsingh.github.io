I have faced these kind of  question many a times;  Do you believe in this? do you believe in that ?  What is your opinion about this thing?.. and among these questions there are two which are very prominent ... <em>Do you believe in God ?</em> and <em>Do you believe in Ghosts? </em>

Already wrote about a ghostly experience  in one of my <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2006/01/27/scary-story/">earlier posts</a>, and not in a mood to write about the scary things, as in a insecure mode right now [reason: a customer bug got reopened ;) , so in office on Sunday ]... so, its time of God rt now ... waise bhi kaha gaya hai ki Musibat ke waqt  Ram Ji ka sumiran karna chahiye :)

Well, my belief in God isnt restricted to Ram Ji or  Shiv Ji, Vishnu Ji, or any Ji for that matter, its not that I am a devotee of the Godesses only, even though my password for my <a href="http://students.iiit.ac.in">students</a> account was "Jai Mata Di" for quiet a long period [3yrs atleast], its something like; I dont want to confine the concept of God in only these names..

The existence of God for in my view  can be most closely described by "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle", so basically his presence depends on the faith you have.. the more you have faith.. the more will be his proximity to you... and vice-a-versa..

That is the product of your faith and his deviation from you is constant.

The shape and the form, in which I see God, varies time to time, though most of the time I prefer calling through my favorite link, Maa Vaishno Devi :) ... but I think there is something which describes him best, is the symbol - Onkar or Aum or Om  <strong>??</strong>

How I see God !! Is another difficult question... First of all I dont fear him, rather I respect his presence around me, helps me in many ways.. most of the times in avoiding the  bad paths.. now the definition of a bad path is also very personal, but the feeling of the presence of an almighty authority helps in deciding that ..

Also, the belief in his presence, makes me stronger from within.. as I always feel that no matter what happens I will never be alone because he is there with me always .. its not that I have got any assurance from him, its just a faith.

[to be continued ..] may be, when the time and mood permits :)
