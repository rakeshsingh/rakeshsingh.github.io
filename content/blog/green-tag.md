A nice way to increase the awareness about nature/environment and help in saving it, thanks to <a href="http://utkarshkhare.blogspot.com">Utkarsh</a> for tagging me up.

There are a few things that I would like to do

1. Minimize use of Plastic/Polythene bags.
2. Plant a tree every year[I already planted one this year ]
3. Will spread awareness about wise use of water and water conservation methods [already started        doing with one of my earlier posts]
4. Won't through empty water bottles on the streets [heard that they are completly recyclable]
5. Will start using  recycled things wherever possible [e.g greeting cards made of recycled paper]
