To IIITians, To my friends and To Everyone else who is reading this post.
<blockquote>
<p align="left">May peace break into your house and may thieves come to steal your debts. May the pockets of your jeans become a magnet for cash. May love stick to your face like Vaseline and may laughter assault your lips! May your clothes smell of success like smoking tires and may happiness slap you across the face and may your tears be that of joy. May the problems you had forget your home address!..</p>
</blockquote>
In simple words ............ Wish you a very happy new year 2007.

[PS:The quoted wishes are taken from an eMail forward, but the feelings are very genuine :)]
