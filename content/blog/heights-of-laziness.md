Sometimes back I was having a talk with Sreejith about how useless a man I have turned into, but he cut me off saying that there are people far far lazier than me. Well, I don't think he will still stick to his opinion after reading this post.

My recent trip to home was jinxed from the very beginning. Probably someone had hexed the train itself. This incident occurred when I was going home.

It so happened that after having an early dinner, I was lying on my birth with half closed eyes and was on the verge of sleeping. Suddenly I started hearing voices  like,

"Who is the owner",
"Where has he gone",
"Don't touch it"
"Stay away from it"
"The days are not that good anymore"
"Look it has something written in Urdu also"

There was a box lying unidentified in the next compartment. The way it was packed it looked very suspicious. Everyone was speculating it to contain a bomb and by the time I had opened my eyes, someone had already informed the railway police about it.

The policemen came, put that box in one corner and started cutting the box. All the people started moving as far away as they can.

For a second even I thought to getup and leave my birth for some farther corner of the coach I wasnt really keen on leaving the covers. So I tried to analyze the situation of how good it will be to sacrifice this slumber.
I thought that there could be two possible situations now

1. If the bomb is made of RDX it will anyway take all of us as the train was still running.

2. and if its a normal bomb it wont do much harm as I am safe behind the walls separating me from the box in the next compartment.

so in any-case there is no point in getting up from my seat.

I was rather pleased with the above reasonings. Felt good about it. Covered myself with the shawl and soon fall asleep, only to wake up in the next morning to find out that the box contained nothing but some dry fruits and a pair of ladies sandals.
