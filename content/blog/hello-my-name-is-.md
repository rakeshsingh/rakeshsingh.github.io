Today's surfing lead me to <a href="http://hellomynameisscott.blogspot.com/">the blog of Scott</a>.

Scott is an author of several books and popularly known as "The Guy with the nametag". He is the only person in the world who wears a nametag 24-7-365 (he has tatooed it :) ), to encourage people to become friendlier and more approachable.

Yeah, he promotes this concept of making yourself approachable both personally and professionally. How to  become unforgettable and make a name for yourself.

Quiet impressive and inspiring thoughts. It encouraged me to go through his posts and have a little chat with him.

The best thing is that Scott himself is the perfect example of his philosophy. Despite all his popularity and busy shcedules he is very approachable and very humble.A small chat with him made me believe that the  first step of success starts with making your name first because as he says <a href="http://hellomynameisscott.blogspot.com/2006/09/people-buy-people-first_09.html">people buy people first</a> and its only later that they go for your product, company, or ideas or whatever they sell.

So go and make yourself a name.
