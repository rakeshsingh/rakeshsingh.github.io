These days Hyderabad is wintessing a  traffic explosion [is there a phrase like this ?? who cares !!]....Poor city, doesnt have enough infrastructure to manage the even existing vehicle population and the count is on a rise every minute...

Till last year only coming from IIIT to Hitec City used to be a smooth ride.. but now every morning I  pray to God once before leaving for office... 

Its barely 6Kms from our home[Telecom Nagar] to Office [Cyber Gateway/Mindspace] but it take 20 mins and that also because we have a bike and we believe in adventure biking [want to know more follow us tomorrow morning ;) ]. Well, if you have a car dont even think to make it before half an hour ...

There are some Hot Spots like Kondapur Chou-Rasta..[basically its a "Tiraha" but again,  who cares ...] Hitech City, Jubilee Hills Check Post etc. where U can easily see a mile long traffic waiting for that damn red signal to turn into green..

...and by Hot spot I mean a real Hot Spot .. like one of our PMCs in college [PMC is short for Piya Milan Chowk :) ]... now the Laila Majnus no longer meet in some old fashioned park or something like that ....now the new age Ghulam no longer sings aati kya khandala .. its aati kya XYZ Chouraha these days...

...well, lets put this traffic thing aside .. there is onething in which Hyderabad is really progressing ... going through the current status of Hyderabad I dont think its ever gonna face a water shortage ... U wont believe me but the ground water level has rised very dramatically over the last couple of weeks, and now we no longer talk about ground water level we talk about above ground water level  .. it was just yesterday the above ground water level in Madhapur was somewhere between 2-3 feets ... and it has nothing to do with the drainage system in Hyderabad.. its working more than fine these days and has carried almost a dozen people with its streams for last couple of months .. thanx  to the Open manholes, Hyderabadis have a new means of travel now.

Well, there are a few more things which might have caught your attention lately, like the new One way Policy of Hyderabad Traffic police .. but as per the movie Hyderbad Blues be a pure Hyderabadi and just take it all lightly because    "Hyderabad main aisa ich hai Yaaron, Dil pe mat le .. Hath main le " ;)
