When we desperately waited for 'yeh jo hai jindagi'
 When chitrahaar, vikram-baitaal, dada daadi ki
 kahaniyaan were so fulfilling ...

 When there was just one tv in every five houses and
 When bisleris were not sold in the trains and we
 were worrying if papas will get back into the train in
 time or not when they were getting down at stations to
 fill up the water bottle ...

 When we were going to bed by 9.00pm sharp except for
 the 'yeh jo hai jindagi' day ...

 When Holis & Diwalis meant mostly hand-made pakwaans
 And sweets and moms seeking our help while preparing them

 When Maths teachers were not worried of our mummys
 and papas while slapping/beating us ...

 When we were exchanging comics and stamps and
 chacha-chaudaris and billus were our heroes ...

 When we were in nanihaals every summer and loved
 flying kites and plucking and eating unripe mangoes
 and leechis ...

 When one movie every Sunday evening on television
 was more than asked for and 'ek do teen chaar' and

 'Rajni' inspired us ...
 When 50 paisa meant at least 10 toffees ...
 When left over pages of the last years notebooks
 Were used for rough work or even fair work ...
 When 'chelpark' and 'natraaj' were encourag ed
 against 'reynolds and family' ...

 When the first rain meant getting drenched and
 playing in water and mud and making 'kaagaj ki kishtis' ...

 When there were no phones to tell friends that we
 will be at their homes at six in the evening ...

 When our parents always had 15 paise blue colored
 'antardesis' and 5 paise machli wale stamps at home

 When we remembered tens of jokes and were not
 finding 'ice-cream and papa' type jokes foolish enough to
 stop us from laughing ...

 When we were not seeing patakhes on Diwalis and
 gulaals on Holis as air and noise polluting or allergic agents ...

 The list can be endless ...on the serious note I would like to
summarise with

 When we were using our hearts more than our brains, even for
scientifically brainy activities like
 'thinking' and 'deciding' ...
 When we were crying and laughing more often, more openly and more
sincerily ...
 When we were enjoying our present more than worrying about our
future
...
 When being emotional was not synonymous to being weak
 When sharing worries and happiness's didn't mean getting vulnerable
to
the listener ...
 When blacks and whites were the favourite colors instead of
greys ...
 When journeys also were important and not just the destinations ...
 When life was a passenger's sleeper giving enough time and
opportunity to enjoy the sceneries from its open and transparent
glass
windows instead of some superfast's second ac with its curtained,
closed and dark windows ...

 I really miss .. do u?
