Just <a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061104/asp/jamshedpur/story_6958197.asp">got referred by Telegraph India</a>.

Their journalist Suchi Arya was doing a report on Jharkhand bloggers and somehow came to know about me.

I know its not a big deal as such but it sure feels good when you get noticed :) .

Update: Suchi pinged back again to tell me about<a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061106/asp/jamshedpur/story_6964867.asp"> the follow up of the above article.Â </a>
