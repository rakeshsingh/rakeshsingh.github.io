Just saw this draft in my mail client ...I had saved this post some 2-3
weeks back for further edition and just forgot to post it ...Well finally I am posting it..

Dreams... one of the most fascinating and mysterious things that God has ever created... and I am experiencing a lot of it, these days [maybe because I am sleeping a lot :) ]

Usually I forget my dreams.. but today it was little different ... As soon as I went to bed, I fell asleep .. and some magical and illogical things started to appear in front of my eyes... at first I saw some very senseless dreams (thank god that I don't remember anything of it now), but after some time all those chaos disappeared .. and my dreams started taking
sensible shapes..

There I saw myself going toward a big lake ... it was very much like the big pond, back in my village, except one thing that it was surrounded by lots of greeneries ... I started swimming there... after some time ... I heard a very familiar voice of this girl ... I turned
around and saw her [taking  her name here, may create a big controversy here :) ]... she too had come  to swim there... so we two started swimming...

After some time I heard her shouting : Help ! help !! she had gone too far and had started drowning in the water... I saved her with my heroic effort but this is not important the
most interesting things were yet to come ... so, I saved her and was giving her the artificial breathing; suddenly she opened her eyes... and saw me.. and then like a typical Hindi movie... we got lost in each other's eyes :) ..

Finally when both of us came to our senses ... we said good bye to each other and went back to our homes...

This didn't stop here ... the very same evening one of my friends came to meet me and said that she wants to talk to me [surprisingly he was aware of everything]...

So we met near this bridge on the river [surprisingly that lake was turned into a river :) ] We were having some formal conversation when she suddenly said "Rakesh, I love you !! " [ ;( for the first time I heard this sentence from a girl and that too in my dream :( ]

Well, at that time I tried to show a little modesty [basically stupidity] and said her that this thing is not gonna work between her and me [what a big ass I am :( ] and finally consoled her to go back to her home...

But after she left, I started have this guilt feeling, that I broke her heart and that I am never going to get another girl like her ... so finally after a lot of thinking... I called her [ I had the latest camera phone of Nokia in my hand :) ]. We talked for an eternity [who cares for the cell phone bill in the dream] and finally we fixed a meeting again in the coffee shop near that bridge [How did Barrista come in my dreams ??]

I was waiting outside the coffee shop when I saw her coming... wow what a scene it was. Very much like the seen of "Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander", where that girl comes to meet the brother of Amir at the end of the song "Pehla Nasha"...

OK she comes and gives me a great hug... and again both of us see in each others eyes and make a move to kiss each other... and suddenly BANG, BANG... some body from this Zaalim Zamana was banging my door... trying to wake me up for the breakfast... [Yaar, ek minute aur ruk jate to tera kya chala jata]

I don't remember the person who wake me up... neither do I remember anything else that I did that day... but its almost a month now and I remember that dream as if I have just woken up from the sleep...

Some dreams you just don't forget.
