"Yaadon ki Baarat nikli hai aaj dil ke dware..." I am listening to
this song and getting nostalgic about the past few year spent in this college.
It has become more than a home to me. I may get bored in my home but here !!
Never !!... the only thing which rarely come closer to us was probably boredom
... There was always something to feel the gap.... Ahhh !! college life is so
fun and hostel life ... well U can't explain... u just need to experience
it to understand what it is... Today I feel like recollecting my memories related
to the time I spent in here and also in making into this place...
