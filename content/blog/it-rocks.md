Just came home after watching "Rock On", and I must say it is indeed a rocking movie.

Music, Story & Acting; everything is top class and I think its probably the best movie of 2008 (When was TZP released?).

After DCH, I have sort of written off Farhan from my diary.. Thinking that probably he is only a one movie wonder. Main reason is DON, somehow even after all this hype and hoopla surrounding it, I found it very mediocre compared to the original DON. The other reason were "Rock On" songs, yeah the music is awesome.. but lyrics are very juvenile (except for one song) and Farhaan please accept the fact that you are not a good singer. BUT, watch the movie and you will realize (I did !), what a natural actor he is. Superb acting, much better than several seasoned actors of bollywood.

Ok, coming back to movie. The story is about four friends, which if you go back to your college days could be anyone of your friends, including yourself. Its about sharing a dream and passion and its about the age old compromises that we make to have a **promising career**. Its tells about shattered dreams and hard hitting realities yet at the same time its also encourages you to go chase your dreams with the inspiring words; that its never too late for anything in life.

The movie also, reminded me a lot of DCH. Especially when the three friends meet in the coffee house and wait for the fourth one to come,Â  very similar to hospital scene in DCH !

All actors have given terrific performances, including the newcomer Sakshi. But I think the find of the movie is Arjun Rampal. This is probably THE movie for him. I have never liked any of his characters so far as much as I liked his role in this movie. In the end of the movie, when he joins his band, he looks like a real rockstar. On a slightly different note his character is the lead guitarist and named as Joe something.. is it just a co-incidence !!

Anyway guitar reminds me of the music once again. Well as I said earlier.. the songs are nothing extra ordinary but within the movie they do become very special.. The tune that is played at the very beginning of the movie, sounds very much like that of "Riders of the Storm" and also in various songs the influence of several popular rock songs is very evident. Well ! Rock lovers please share your thoughts if you also felt the same. Kudos to Shankar Ehsaan and Loy for the magikal music.

Well ! There are hundreds of things that I can write for this movie right now . But its kind of late for me. So stopping here one last sentence.

Watch Rock On, if you haven't seen it so far.
