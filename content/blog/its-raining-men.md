yeah, the weather is very cool here and when many of my friends are soaking their shirts in their respective jobs, I still have time to  listen to RHTDM songs while its raining outside... Well, Jaya and Khare don't get Jealous mera bhi no aayega jab mujhe boring counselling sessions attend karni padengi.. but till then I can make you jealous by reminiding the total timepass days of IIIT.

Just have a look at the wet IIIT [though the photograph is little old]

The weather is too good here and just perfect for blogging. Donno where are others. Ranta has just come back from his home and must have gone to meet his love attraction "Server-Room" and "CVIT". Vidit is nowhere to be seen since yesterday. He is working hard to prove that now he is a researcher.. I think so far half of the library books would have shaken hands with him :)
