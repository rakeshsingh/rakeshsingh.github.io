I am a dedicated wordpress user and always keep an eye over whats happening in the wordpress users community.
Recently I saw two blog-events which caught my attention.
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://bhuvans.wordpress.com/">Bhuvana Sundarmoorthy</a> wrote a post on <a href="http://bhuvans.wordpress.com/2006/08/19/50-common-interview-qa/">50 common interview questions</a> and overnight she became the most popular blogger on wordpress surpassing <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Scobleizer</a>.</li>
	<li>A techie started posting about the upcoming <a href="http://walkin.wordpress.com/">walkins in India</a> and got so popular that now nearly <strike>2000Â  </strike>3500 readers are subscribed to it.</li>
</ol>
The above two blogs just fit into a category of blogs which I call as <em>Joblogs</em>, i.e. a blog which is dedicated towards jobs and provides the information about job openings, job questions etc.
I already knew that jobs and job searches are getting popular day by day but didnt much look into the direction of utilising blogs to broadcast the job info directly to each and every interested user.

But now when I think, it looks so obvious to me. I guess people like <a href="http://gigaom.com/">gigaom </a>and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> already understood the potential of joblogs and thats why they came with their own flavors of joblogs, namely <a href="http://gigaomjobs.com/">gigaomjobs </a>and <a href="http://jobs.joelonsoftware.com/">job.joelonsoftware</a>.

At the local front, <a href="http://www.naukri.com">Naukri</a> is already providing <a href="http://corp.naukri.com/mynaukri/mn_rss.php?othersrcp=2729&wExp=N">rss feeds of job openings</a> in various categories for quiet some time now. Though it looks like <a href="http://www.monsterindia.com">monsterindia</a> still needs to catch up with the concept of job feeds.

Good to see this change happening. Now if you are looking for a job you dont need to go search for it but it will itself come to you, just subscribe to the relevant rss feeds.

So, go and get yourself a <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">bloglines</a> account, just in case you dont already own one.
