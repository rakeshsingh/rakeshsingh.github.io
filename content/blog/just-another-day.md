well last night (morning would be more appropriate) I slept @ 4am
after watching <b> Kyun Ho Gaya Na</b> ... movie was ok .. not very
good .. a typical romantic Hindi movie and almost predictable ... Ash
was looking veryyyyy beautiful... Amitabh was a little boring ... his
role could have been easily avoided ...
... I think indian cinema makers should learn something from hollywood
directors... if you are making a love story make it like <i> A Walk to
remember ...</i> .. This movie changed my perception about Hollywood
that they can't make a romantic movie with songs...  Though I have
seen some of the very good romantic movies like "You have got mail",
"Notting Hill", " A walk in the clouds" ... but  "A walk to remember"
is The Best.... just see the lead pair in the following pic

write about today :) ..
