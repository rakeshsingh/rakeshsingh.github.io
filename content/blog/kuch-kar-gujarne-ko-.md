<blockquote><em>Sarfaroshii <strong>ki</strong> tamannaa ab hamaare dil mein hai
Dekhna hai zor kitana baazu-e-qatil mein hai
Rahrave raahey mohabbat reh na jaana raah mein
Lazzat-e-sahraanawardi doori-e-manzil mein hai
Waqt aaney de bataa deingey tujhe ae aasmaaN
Hum abhi se kya bataayein kya hamaarey dil mein hai
Ae shaheed-e-mulk-o-millat main terey oopar nisaar
Ab terii himmat ka chacha ghair <strong>ki</strong> mehfil mein hai</em></blockquote>
... the immortal words of Ram Prasad Bismil in Atul Kulkarni's voice and the whole theatre fills with the never ending round of applauses... and you realize that you are not just watching a movie ... you are a part of it ... this is what <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405508/">Rang De Basanti</a> is... a movie which is very moving...

I didnt see any Aamir movie since DCH [havent seen <strong>Man Pan</strong> yet]... and Rang De Basanti, or RDB as I prefer to say, was something which I was waiting for quiet some time ... and it fared way beyond my expectations...

RDB, is a movie which has all the best points and some more of two of my most favorite movies.. DCH and Swades, as in it is both youth centric [<em>the DCH factor</em>] and also a very nationalist movie...

It completes the trilogy of movies built with the same concept that <a title="Nationalism" href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2005/03/28/we-have-to-be-the-change-we-want-to-see/">we ourselves will have to be the change what we want to see around us</a>.. The first two being <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382383/">Yuva</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367110/">Swades</a>.

All these movies have tried to realize us the same thing...  stop cribbing about the fate of the nation... and take charge of the situation and try to improve it...

So be its Michael Mukherjee in Yuva or Mohan Bhargava in Swades or Daljeet and the gang of RDB, the chanting is same... take action .. do something ... enter the system to change it ... there is no easy way to do it as Bhagat Singh himself said .. <em>Jo kan sun nahi sakte, unke liye Dhamake ki jaroorat hoti hai</em> ...
The only thing is that we should have complete faith and full control on our actions... that is the the efforts which we are taking should be taken with well intention and need to be carried with great responsibility... because we have seen rebellions with good motives turning into mere naxalites and also we should see that today's <a href="http://www.paritrana.org/index.htm">Paritrana</a> doesnt turn into another <em>Chhatra Aandolan</em> and produce tomorrow's Laloo Yadavs.

anyways Best of Luck India... Kyunki ..
