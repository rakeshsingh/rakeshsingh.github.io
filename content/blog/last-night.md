.. it was amazing.. though from traditional perspective  it won't give any good impression .. but I enjoyed; enjoyed a lot last night... First time in my life I got drunk , it wasn't the first time when I tasted wine ... but it was the first time when I really felt that I am drunk... and what followed next was also unforgettable ... all of us, were truely ourselves... no  hypocrisy... just the reality ... and the confessions .... wow.. I really got to know some new facts ... can't write it here .. becoz some of those were really personal.. 
... the only thing that I want to do now is I want to get drunk once again ...
