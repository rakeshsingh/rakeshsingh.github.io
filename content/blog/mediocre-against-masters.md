Everywhere around us, we see a general pattern. The presence of masters, who dominate it in a particular field, be it studies, sports, job, relationships. They set the standards in their area of expertise, others just aspire to become like them.

Now, we have only two options when we are facing such guys, 1: Get inspired by them 2: Hate them and try all your might and tactics to pull them down in the drain...

While we know that most of the guys follow the route-1 there are a hell lot of them who fell in this second category, who hardly digest any form of excellence and always try to find some fault or another in it.

Those of you, who have read Fountainhead (which deals this topic in detail) may correlate it better with the example of an perfectionist  and master of his art, Howard Roark and  Ellisworth Toohey, the messiah of mediocres.

Ellisworth Toohey in the entire novel, does nothing but misguide the masses using his newspaper against the shear brilliance of Howard Roark.

Now, I saw a classic example of a similar situation in Zee News yesterday.  Here the zee news reports were doing the Toohey for our cricketing Howard Roark, Sachin Tendulkar.

The reporters of ZEE TV came with  this catchy report called "Slow Sachin", where they were trying to take the stats of last 3 matches of India and trying to say that Sachin has slowed down.

Initially I did agree with them for the fact that Sachin has indeed played little slower in last three matches and there intention looked fair enough. But very soon the report start taking an ugly direction where they started coming up with theories cooked up in their nasty mind, with the statments like
<ul>
	<li>Sachin can not play fast bowlers.</li>
	<li>Sachin plays only for records. He stayed in the ground just to complete his 50 so that he can make another world record of highest half centuries.</li>
	<li>Sachin can not complete a century he always gets out close to it.</li>
	<li>Sachin always throws away his wickets.</li>
</ul>
To support their theories and take public opinion they talked to exactly 2 people and deduced that the Indian public also thinks that Sachin has lost it.

I usually stay away from the abuses, but I would like to say a big FUCK YOU to all such reporters out there.

The thing is when you don't have the qualifications and credibility to comment on something, better don't do it. To all you suckers saying, slow Sachin, I think you forgot the very first lesson that was taught to you in the English class that Slow and Steady wins the race and yeah he did help India win yesterday's game.

The second thing is if you are commenting on Cricket, spend some time knowing it. What is the basic difference between the various forms of the game. A ODI is not an Tweny overs, you have to play for 50 overs, so someone will have to stay there guarding the wickets. Thats the very same reason that even though a max of 36 runs can be scored in every over we hardly see any team crossing a 400 mark.

For the second point I would like to say that saying an statement is very easy but making an statement is very difficult. Sachin has made an statement in his game. Its just not that he has made records, it is the fact that he has played that well, which has resulted in the form of world records. You pessimists... the glass is half filled, u see.

Though I didn't want to comment on the third point for the very reason that how bullshit can someone's argument be. F**k U.. Who gives a damn that he has made a century or not.. I think Sachin himself will be more happy, if he scores a beautiful 99 and helps India win...

Now for the last point, I remember Kapil Dev, in a news interview sometime back (during T20 series), where he got angry on one such remark for Dhoni, where they said that Dhoni has thrown away his wicket (dont remember which match it was, Dhoni was declared run out in that). Kapil said one thing which was like, "Don't write off someone for his mistake but see what he intended to do". Yes, its the noble intention that makes these players stand tall in a crowd and its the very same noble intention, that you cheap people wont ever understand, because its such an rare thing, especially in your case.

People like Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar are a jewel in India's crown. After 1983 cricket world cup the second best thing that happened to Indian cricket is Sachin Tendulkar. For me and many people like me, he has been the major reason behind watching Cricket.

Sachin is surely getting old but he has still loads of cricket left in him and one thing I know for sure that the day he feels that he is losing his touch, he wont hesitate a second before declaring his retirement. I just wish that, that day doesnt come in near future.

Now, before I finish this post. I have just one thing to request to all of you reporters out there. Go and watch Spiderman and try to understand  that with great power comes great responsibility and from now onward, just  try to be a little more responsible towards your remarks.
