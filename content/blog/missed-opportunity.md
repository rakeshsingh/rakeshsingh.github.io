Back at the time of +2 (Intermediate actually), I always used to wonder about Newton's gravitional laws, thinking; whats so special in them .. even I could have given such laws.. its just that I came a little later on this earth, otherwise  those laws would have been named on me ...
Something similar happened today also, I was thinking about this idea to make a new chatroom kind of thing, which is more useful for a project team in the offices ... guess what, <a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/02/15/37signals-launches-camp-fire/">Om</a> says, some one has already made <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">this</a> ... grrr ... another missed opportunity... :(
But the optimist in me sees that the time difference is decreasing, first it were a few years, now its just a few months. So for the next time, hopefully you'll see my name on my idea ...

untill then, wait and keep an eye on <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com">Rakesh's Place</a>
