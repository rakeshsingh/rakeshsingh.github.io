Movie: "Salaam Namaste"
My Rating: Good [3 *s out of 5]
Songs: Hummable, go with the mood of the movie. BUT aint gonna last till next Yash Chopra Flick...
Acting: Ok Ok .. 
Locations: Gr8.. I would love to have the house shared by Neak and Amber [Saif & Preity]
Masala Part: 
[For boys] Too many girls in bikini on a beach for the title song which seems out of place
[For girls] Saif's new avtaar as Salman part II, Cameo by AB junior[??].. 

Overall: Saif and Preity looked good together...  but the entire movie filled me with a  sense  of deja-vu ..

E.G.
1. Arshad's dance in the car: Chandler's dance in F.R.I.E.N.D.S
2. Saif and Preity and the pregnancy stuff : Didnt U see this in "Kya Kehna"
3. Coincidences + Misunderstanding : any other Hindi movie
4. Delivery Drama:  seems seen somewhere in F.R.I.E.N.D.S
