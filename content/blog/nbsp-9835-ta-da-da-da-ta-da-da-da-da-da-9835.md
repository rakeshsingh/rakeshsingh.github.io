<p>How do you decide, which mobile connection you are going to take... Attractive Schemes, Good Connectivity, a better customer support system... hmmm the list will keep on growing if you think a lot ...<br /> </p><p>anyway, I had to change my old Airtel prepaid connection with a post paid connection ... and there were some good options in the market, from Hutch to BSNL,  from Idea to Airtel... and I had almost decided to go for Reliance Joy... </p><p>Then I saw this new ad of AIRTEL ... </p><blockquote><p>Nigahein nigahon se mila kar to dekho,<br />Naye logon se rishta bane ke to dekho,<br />Hasratein dil me chupane se kya faida,<br />Apne honth hila kar to dekho<br />Aasmaan simat jayega aagosh mein,<br />Chahat ki baahein faila kar to dekho<br />Dil ki baat kar ke to dekho...</p></blockquote><p>There is something unsaid in this ad, which never let me thought about another service providers, and forced to remain loyal to Airtel. and thats it .. I am back once again in Bharti bandwagon to enjoy more of that lovely jingle by Rehman...</p><p> </p><blockquote><p>♪ Ta Da-Da-Da, Ta-Da Da-Da Da-Da ♫</p><p>♪ Ta-Da Da-Da Da-Da-Da, Da Da-Da-Da ♫ </p></blockquote><p> </p><p> </p>
