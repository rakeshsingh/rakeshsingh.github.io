Just another day in office... I am working on one of those bugs ... when the phone rings... I look at the number .. some unknown local number.. I take the call.. a female voice speaks from the other end ...

FV: Sirrr, Good afternoon Sirrr !

Me: Good afternoon. Tell me !

FV: Sirrr ! We are offering a life time free credit card, Sirrr !!

Me: I don't want it. I already have lots of them. Thank You !!

FV: But Sirrr, its from Reliance.

Me: (Reliance Card! What the heck !!) Since when Reliance started offering credit cards ??

FV: Sirrr, its good Sirrr !!

Me: Let it be, I don't want it. Thank You !!

FV: Sirrr ! Another thing !!

Me: What now ? Any contact numbers !! Sorry for that too.

FV: Naut Sirrr !! Its something else.

Me: What ?

FV: Your ringtone Sirrr (actually she was saying about my Hellotune). Its good Sirrr. I like this song Sirrr.

Me: Ok. Thank You :)

FV: Sirrr !

Me: What ?

FV: Sirrr !! I will call you Sirrr!! You don't pick the phone Sirrr. Your ringtone is good Sirrr ! I want to listen Sirr.

Me: But ....  Ok no problem :)

after this I cut the call and put the mobile phone on silent mode ... after about  one hour or so when I checked the phone again... it  had 21 missed calls from the same number :)

Shit, She just turned my phone into her favorite radio station :(
