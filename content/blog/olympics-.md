Watching Opening Ceremony right now. The Indian team just marched ahead.

Commentators speak... " India, A billion people strong country .. with just 57 participants, and no Hocky team for the first time in last 88 years".

I guess without the Hockey Team, it might also be the smallest Indian team in Olympics in last 2-3 decades. With decreasing participation, how could we expect to win more medals !!

On a different and highly positive note:
In 2000 Olympics, We got a Bronze..
In 2004 Olympics, We got a Silver...

In 2008...., WE WON A GOLD

[Oh, How I wish so much to fill the above sentence with those Golden Words.]

Woh kahte hain na, If you want something very badly, then the whole world conspires you to achieve it.Â  Its true.
