<blockquote>Guru Govind Dono Khade
Kaake Lagoon Paaye
Balihari Guru Aapne,
Govind Diyo Bataaye.
--Kabir Das

Meaning: If My Guru and God himself were to stand infront of me, to whom should I bow first. Well, I choose you my teacher because If you hadnt been there I would have never known what God is.</blockquote>
Saluting my teachers on their very own day. We would have been nothing without them.

Thank You Teachers.
