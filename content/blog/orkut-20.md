Dont go by the title, Orkut was always a web 2.0 portal as far as the technology and the concept is concerned. Its just that only recently I am witnessing a suddent surge in its usage around me and a new look of Orkut, which makes it not just a community site but a communication medium.

There was a time when every other day I used to get invitation from my friends to join a brand new community site; be it a social one like  <a href="http://www.mulitply.com">Multiply</a>, <a href="http://www.orkut.com">Orkut</a>, <a href="http://www.fropper.com">Fropper</a>, <a href="http://www.hi5.com">Hi5</a>, Judy's Book, <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> (God ! how many of them are there) .. or a business networking .. Ryze, Rediff Connexions, Linked In and so on ..

I joined all of them but it was Orkut only which made a lasting impression and I became regular visitor. one reason could have been that somewhere down the lane the word Google was associated with it ...

Anyway my first experience with Orkut wasnt that pleasant. Every other time when I used to login.. it used to greet with a very nasty messsage "Bad bad server, No Doughnuts for You"

Thanks to some groundwork done by the Orkut guys, the server has become quiet stable now and the user count too, has increased exponentioally. Everyday I get a new invitation to add as a friend and all these new member (the latest are my team mates) are so much devoted .

Everyone is coming to Orkut. From a 70 year old Talat Aziz fan to a 4 yr old Krrish Fan. And it has really helped me to connect with some of my long lost friends. I found one of my distant cousin in Orkut, he was living next door to me for more than a year but none of us had a clew.

If Orkut's reach will go on like this,I think in the next Bollywood flick we will see, two brothers who got separated In Kumbh Fare are meeting in the Orkut :)

I am probably one of the laziest members of Orkut as even after the 3yrs presence here I have managed to accumulate only some 500+ scraps ... but I know people who deal in thousand of scraps, have a friend count close to 1k and Coolness,Trusty, Sexyness > 90%.

The latest status symbol is not how many girl friends you have but how many FANS you have in orkut. Gone are the days of eMail and IMs.. the in thing is Scraps.

Scrapping is becoming such a popular practice that you can get serveral desktop softwares just to make it simple for you to scrap. My favorite of them all are <a href="http://www.scrapboy.com"> Scrapboy</a> and <a href="http://www.apcsoftware.com.br/ingles/">Orkut Cute</a>. You can check "<a href="http://insideorkut.blogspot.com">Inside Orkut"</a> for more such tools and hacks.

Another thing by which I measure the popularity is by spams, first it was emails, then blogs and now Orkut. It is affected with all sorts of spams. Comment spams, Fake users, Spam comments in communities, spam scraps !!

Well, the entire internet is fighting with the spammers, I hope Orkut guys will also succeed in it and present us a more cleaner and stable orkut.

Happy Orkutting.
