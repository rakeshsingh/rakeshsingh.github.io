Yesterday we were chating near the coffee shop about US universities and how to get admission etc.. and suddenly this issue of culture came in between. One of us said that US has no culture. May be he wanted to frame it in a different words but more or less the gist was that they don't have what we call "Parampara and Sanskar". 

I have a very different opinion about it. What I think is that we are just like any other country with our own beliefs and behavior and which can't be compared to any other nation. We Indians have got this misconception that we are culturally superior to everyone else in the world. Culture, what I think is our identity and we should take it like that only. Its something like our hair or skin color, some people have fair skin while some are black, some might have curly hairs and some might have smooth and silky hair. There are differeces everywhere and this difference doesn't make anyone less human or something like that. We should identify this difference and appreciate it.

and again considering others less worthy is not in our culture. All the great thinkers and reformers of India have always reminded us of appreciating other's culture, respecting them and work in harmony to make a global family :"Vasudheva Kutumbakam".
