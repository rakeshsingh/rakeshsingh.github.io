my wordpress stats says that I am getting popular day by day ... people are finding time to visit my blog even on the first day of the year .. thats nice ...

but folks, I will always suggest to celebrate new year by freaking out and spending time with your loved once and not with the "Intelligent Box"...

Happy New Year once again :)
