...there are somethings which make you realize the bitter truths of the life ... we work for our respective companies.. thinking that probaly this is  <strong>The Company</strong> for me and start building our Dreams based on the false hopes and promises given to us, until comes a day when we are shown the doors of the office, as if we are nothing but a piece of trash...

Well, its not something that happened to me ... but it hurts when your friends get hurt ...  I have always believed that everything happens for a good cause, lets hope this also ends in something good ... but one thing is for sure we should always keep in mind that we are just <strong>"Resources"</strong> for our companies, no human feelings attached to it... Its all business, nothing personal you know ;)

well, going back to work ...  have to work on some new project, my team is falling short of "resources"...
