<i>    Remember, remember the fifth of November,
gunpowder, treason and plot,
I see no reason why gunpowder treason
should ever be forgot.</i>

I remember reading a chapter about english festivals, in my primary school . There was this festival with a very amusing name, we used to pronounce it as Gai [as in cow :) ] Fox's Day.

One day just out of curiousity I asked my teacher about the origin of this festival, it was then only when I came to know about Guy Fawkes, who along with several others, planned to blow up the english parliament and in the process got caught and since then people started celebrating this Guy Fawkes Day.

Kids have a tendency to relate one event to another. We were taught about indian festivals as well, for example Deepawali; when Lord Rama Killed Ravana and came back to his place and people started celebrating the festival as the symbol of victory of good over evil.

As a rule of inference I concluded Guy Fawkes to be a bad guy.

Well, I rarely got time to look back upon the story of Guy Fawkes, even though he is present around us all the time [ever wondered from where the word "Guy" came ?] untill I watched this movie V for Vendetta.

Now this is the story of a guy V, who like "The Guy", gets fed up with the system(read government) and tries to shake it up by blasting off the Assemebly.

To simple an idea, isnt it ? Well, not exactly. The purpose is very nobel. Assembly, according to V is an symbol of slavery, a blind faith, and by blasting it he wants to awake people to think for their rights and fight for it.

Its an step like what the youngters tried to do in RDB or in a real world what Bhgat Singh tried to do when he threw bombs in parliament.

The timing of the movie coudnt have been any better, I saw it after Rang De Basanti and in the midst of this new Reservation Law news. I feel that some day this reservation thing will lead to a big disaster [can I say it a revolt].

The politicians like Vishwanath Pratap Singh and Arjun Singh will keep coming... and this reservation or quota system will go worse and worse... I wonder when will this hunger for votes will end... may be at 99.99% reservation in everything imaginabale... will people stay silent till that time... I guess not ...

Why is that Government does not learn from its mistakes. At the time of Mandal Comission itself, students had come on road showing their anger, and protesting against it...

Why is that these Arjun Singhs dont understand that some day the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Goswami">"Rajiv Goswami"</a> s of India might change their mind and instead of self-immolating themselves, turn into another V and start burning these politicians alive.

This could happen, but it can be stopped. Stop it now you idiots or very soon we will get a new date to replace the 5th of november in..
