Back at the time of my Intermediate College days, when I used to study in S. P. College Dumka.... I  stayed in a rented house, with my brother and one of my friends Rajeev...

...this house was behind our University... there was a boundary wall between our house and the near-by government staff colony... very few people used to stay in that colony... on the right side, there were two three more houses but most of them were not occupied, ... in front of my house there was a <em>kachha </em>road and in front of that there was a big football ground ...to summarize it all ... there were very few persons living in the next one square kilometer area :(

the roof of this house was made of tiles... there were two giant <em>Semal </em>trees, besides my house... during the rainy seasons, the fruit [not eatable :( ] of these trees used to fall on the roof, making a very strange noise as if some has just jumped on the roof :( ...

coming back to the story,  It was one of those cold and stormy nights in the monsoon season... I was alone in my room, as it was saturday and my brother and friend had left for home,   they were going to board a bus, which was supposed to leave at 8 PM... I stayed back because because I had to finish some assignments.
So I was sitting alone in the room, trying to do the assignments... the weather outside was very bad ... it was one of those cold and stormy nights ...It had rained very heavily late in the evening and was still drizzling...as it was cold, I had wrapped myself in a blanket... the fruits of the Semal tree were falling in every minute or so,creating a very scary atmosphere and making me unable to sleep...

I was almost done with my assignments and about to go to bed, when I heard a knock on the door ... as I was not sure who is there at the door at this point of time, I asked who is there ... Its Rajeev.. came the reply ...hesitantly I opened the door.. and found Rajeev standing outside completely drenched and shivering... I asked him to come in and change the cloths..
I was glad  that atleast I now  I am not alone ... Meanwhile Rajeev had changed his cloths.. and had worn some warm clothes and sitting on the edge of the other bed ... I just asked him about why he is so late and where is Bhaiya [my brother].. he said that the bus was late.. so he came back ...  and bhaiya stayed there to catch the bus...

then we got involved in some other talks about how bad is the weather.. and the road is really  bad ... they shouldnt have left home ... also I was worried about my brother...finally I said, its late .. I think we should go to sleep now...

at this point Rajeev said .... wait I have to say something to you ..

Me: what ??

Rajeev: Have you ever talked to a ghost or have you seen a ghost ..
Me: No.. why are you talking about such things at this point of time..

Rajeev: Ghosts, are just like me and you..

Me: [little scared now] how do you know ?!?!

Rajeev: Because I am one.....

[ now the way Rajeev told this, without changing his facial expressions.. his words just hit me .. and made me believe that I am really talking to a ghost... I was scraed to death ]

Rajeev: The bus that we boarded today.. met an accident ... because of this rain and poor roads .. bus slipped and fell into a ditch... many persons died .. I was one of them .. bhaiya has suffered some major injuries .. but he is alive ...

Me: [watching him like a deaf and dumb ... totally numb .. wasnt even able to close my eyelids]...

Rajeev: As you were closest to the spot ... I came here to tell this news..

Me:[... no words..]

Rajeev: Rakesh, I feel very sad.. Wont be able to meet my parents now ... they were so proud of me ... do tell me that I was a good student and a very good human being ...

Me:..... O.... Ok ..

Rajeev: Seems you dont believe me ... you will come to know when you will read the newspaper, tomorrow..

Me: [trying to get some control on me .. and trying to show that I am not scared]

Me: I... I ... I dont believe you... there is no such thing like ghosts... and even if they are.. I dont think you are ... I.. I have heard that ghosts dont have shadows... and there legs are bent backwards ... [... what a lame statement :) ]
Rajeev: Thats why I asked you earlier ... you never met a ghost before ... good by rakesh... you were a nice friend .. I will miss your company ..
in reply to this I just told him that I dont want to listen more crap .. and feeling very sleepy  [which was an absolute lie]... and going to sleep now ..

then I just grabbed my blanket and covered myself... reciting all the Gayatri Mantras and Hanuman Chalisas ... even next day morning I didnt woke up untill he got up from his bed and went out ...

I never accepted this to him, but I think he understood it very well..  that night was the scariest night for me ..
