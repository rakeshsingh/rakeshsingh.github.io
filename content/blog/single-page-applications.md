The term Single Page Applications (SPA) along with SPADE, has come very recently mainly with this Ruby on Rails. The concept is to make a rich web application that needs only the browser and css, javascript and html.

Imagine you have a wiki/blog which doesnt require any server-side scripiting, no dataBases, nothing  but  a plain html file, which you can edit on the fly.

Well, thanks to the new generation web-browsers (read FireFox), this is a very possible idea now and there are some very cool SPA applications already in the existence.

Just try out the <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki </a>and  <a href="http://trimpath.com/demos/nextaction_static1/nextaction.htm">NextAction </a>and I am sure you too will fall in love with them.
