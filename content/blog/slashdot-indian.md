For the first time saw <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/science/05/03/07/1914259.shtml?tid=160&tid=103&tid=14">a post </a> by an Indian in slashdot... 

I have seen several indian names in the comments list but never really saw any one as a news contibutor... Well, may be I am not a regular reader of slasdot.
