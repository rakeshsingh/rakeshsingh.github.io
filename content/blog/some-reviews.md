Saw a lots of movies recently.. here are my reviews, better late than never ..

<strong>1. Deewane Hue Paagal</strong>

Story: Copy of "There is something about mary"

Acting: Pathetic, only Akshay and Paresh rawal have done some justice to there role.

Music: Okie Okie type... can tolerate in the movie ..

Rating: *[Below Average]

Overall: you can leave it if you something else to see

<strong>2. Neal and Nikki</strong>

Story: Nothing new, a copy past from here and there .. a complete situation is take as it is from "My Sassy Girl", bollywood grow up ... I didnt expect this from Yashraj Production

Acting: Who cares when its a sex comedy...

Music: Some songs are good ... can humm it outside the theatres also..

Rating: ** [Average]

Overall: Another Bollywood Masala Movie, lots of skin show, as Neal [Gurneel Ahluwali] says in the very first line of the movie, this is a typical indian movie with nothing Indian in it ;) watch it with friends, but dont go with family..

<strong> 3. Ek Ajnabee</strong>

Story: Bollywood "Man on Fire".. again the same old thing .. bollywood desperately needs some writers.. where are the Javed Akhtars of Indian Cinema...

Acting: Amitabh is there what should you expect.. another good performance by the legend ... we are fortunate for us that we are seeing more of him these days .. but unfortunately he is not getting good roles..

Music: Goes with the mood of movie.. nothing to be remembered as such .. the title song is good though..

Rating: **1/2 [better than an average movie]

Overall: Go for Amitabh, and the beautiful Perizaad [though she has not much to do in the movie] ...

<strong>4. Bluffmaster</strong>

Storyline: Well cant say that this was an original story.. but still it was better than others.. though looks very much influenced by "The Game"

Acting: Abhishek, Riteish, Nana, Boman Irani and [for a change] Priyanka  Chopra, all have done justice to their roles...

Music: Sounds good.. some of the songs are still in my playlist ... my favorites .. bure bure (rap song), Say-Na Say-Na and the rap song Right Here- Right Now..
Rating: *** (not that good .. but still best in the market)

Overall: Bunty of Bunty & Babli fame is back with a new name Roy, so nothing new for Abhishek as such, Riteish has done a good job .. and the music is good ... and Nana Patekar is marvellous ...

<strong>Chalte Chalte</strong>: Except for the first movie, Abhishek is in all the other movies... So get ready to have a overdose of him ..
