My recent favorite song for the last few days is "Kya Mujhe Pyaar Hai" from the upcoming movie "Woh Lamhe". The lyrics is beautifully written and  Kay Kay has sung brilliantly.

The music is just too good  especially the opening guitar riff. Even though it is a blatant lift of the track  "Tak Bisakah" by PeterPan(<a href="http://www.archive.org/download/Peter_Pan__Tak_Bisakah/PeterpanTakBisakah.mp3">mp3</a> here) but still I would like to thank the music director, Pritam for introducing us with such a good music.

Well, I dont have much interest in the story of Woh Lamhe as it is based on the high profile romance of Mahesh Bhatt and Parveen Babi but considering the impresseive performances of Shiney Ahuja in his last few films, (Hazaar Khwahishein..., Gangster) I am expecting it to be a good movie.

Lets see.

Lyrics of the song:
<blockquote>kyun aaj kal, nind kam khwab jyada hai
lagta khuda ka, koi nek irada hai
kal tha faqir aaj dil shehzada hai
lagta khuda ka koi nek irada hai

kya mujhe pyar hai ...
kaisa khumar hai ...
kya mujhe pyar hai ...
kaisa khumar hai ...

Ho O oh . Ho O oh..

paththar ke in raston pe
phoolon ki ek chadar hai
jabse mile ho humko
badla har ek manzar hai

dekho jahan main nile nile aasmaan tale
rang naye naye  hain jaise ghulte hue
soye se khaab mere, jaage tere waste
tere khayalon se hain, bheege mere raaste

kya mujhe pyar hai ...
kaisa khumar hai ...
kya mujhe pyar hai ...
kaisa khumar hai ...

Ho O oh . Ho O oh..

tum kyun chale aate ho
har roj in khwabon main
chupke se aa bhi jao main
ek din meri baahon main

tere hi sapne andheron main ujalo main
koi nasha hai, teri aankhon ke pyalon main
tu mere khwabon main jawaabon main saawalon main
har din chura tumhe main lata hoon khyalon main</blockquote>
