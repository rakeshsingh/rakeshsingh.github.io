..this is the fifth time in this week, when I am trying to write a new post .. donno what is the actual reason.. but I m not getting that feeling of blogging what I used to have during college days ...

but today I m going to finish it ..no matter how much time it takes or no matter how much crap I put here .. 

lets see what I have to write ... k I can write about last few days .. 

last few days have been kind of special for me ... experienced some new things... 
first of all joind this job as "applications engineer" at oracle IDC [though I am still not sure what my work is going to be ... and even if I get to know .. I cant' disclose .. its going to be confidential] ... 

there are many things which I have experienced here ... first of all I don't think I m going to get any benefit of being a comp sc student with an honours in databases.. ppl from mechanical and electronics departments look better prepared and ofcourse a lot more hardworking then me :)

Second, seniors here are technically very sound, I'll have to work really hard [which is a distant probablity for me] to come even close to them..

What next .. 
K ... we got this house in Telecomnagar, with absolutely no efforts...we didn't give the security deposits, didn't have to make rounds with the property dealers or anything like that, unlike Jaya and the gang...

for all my batchmates... whenver you get bored with college life, you can come to 
this friendly neighbourhood of yours... 
just note down the address 

148-A,
TELECOM NAGAR(Behind Trinethra)
Gachibowli
Hyderabad-19
