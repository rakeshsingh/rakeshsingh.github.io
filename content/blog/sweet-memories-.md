</font> He talked to me sometime back and asked me if I would forget him after college. Well, to say the truth, he is one of those guys I would probably never forget. He was my windmate in first sem and our roll no's are adjacent. So we had copied together in a number of tests and exams :) (well most of the times, I had copied from him). Like me, he also has a taste for bengali movies. Is a nice guy to talk to and spreads happiness wherever he goes...

</font> A gem of a person. He is one of the few who has won respect from all, and he deserves it. A very hard and thorough worker, he deserves the best of everything.
