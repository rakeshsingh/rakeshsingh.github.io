What you do,when you have nothing else to do... by nothing I mean you are done with your work (if there is any) and surfing and chatting and blogging... everything that gives a purpose to your life...

for me its going to the cafeteria and pouring myself a cup full of cappuccino... hmm that smell...  lets you forget everything and refreshes you like you have just woken up from a deep and sound sleep...

Well, No one can understand the truth until he drinks of coffee's frothy goodness..

Still, sitting on your desk !! Wake up you u moron ... Its Coffee time :)
