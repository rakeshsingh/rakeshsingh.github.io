A few mins back I was listening to the song "American Pie" by Don Mclean,  out of curiousity, I searched google for its lyrics and came to know about the history of the song...

interesting, you might want to have a look on this <a title="bye bye miss american pie .." href="http://www.rareexception.com/Garden/Pie.php">link</a>

one excerpt from the article :

<em>I drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry, Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singing "This'll be the day that I die, This'll be the day that I die."</em>
<ul><em>Driving the Chevy to the levee almost certainly refers to the three college students whose murder was the subject of the film 'Mississippi Burning.' The students were attempting to register as black voters, and after being killed by bigoted thugs their bodies were buried in a levee. Them good ol' boys being: <a href="http://www.rareexception.com/Garden/Rock/Buddy.php">Holly</a>, Valens, and the Big Bopper, They were singing about their death on February 3. One of <a href="http://www.rareexception.com/Garden/Rock/Buddy.php">Holly's</a></em> hits was "That'll be the Day"; the chorus contains the line "That'll be the day that I die."</ul>
