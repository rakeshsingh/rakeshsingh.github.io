Just finished reading this novel. Written by Ayn Rand, this one is very different from the other novels which  I used to read earlier.. I mean much better then of the Sheldon's, Ludlum's, King's etc This novel talks about Heroics and cowards .. the concept of purity and impurity of soul... the selfishness and selflessness ... and is a heroic attempt to save heroism from second handers ... This is story of an Architect for whom his work is his God and his religion... and all through the book he alone fights with the world to save his religion/Profession which has already been polluted by the intellectually deprived once.  Surely it is one of the best novels I have read so far.. I have become fond of the writer  and looking forward to read her another novel "The Atlas Shrugged" -- ‹^› ‹(•¿•)› ‹^›
