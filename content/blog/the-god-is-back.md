with a <a href="http://imsports.rediff.com/score/in_match8044.html">bang.</a>

[The above pic is from Today's  India Vs <strike>Sri Lanka</strike> West Indies match, where Sachin is waving to the crowds after reaching his <strike>half</strike> century. When I started writing this post first Sachin was at 101 and still playing. ]

Update: <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/dlfcup/engine/match/256607.html">Final scorecard</a> read Sachin 141[not out] with 18 fours and 5 sixes, now thats called a comeback.

Update2: Its Sachin's <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/sports/cricket/cricshowstory.asp?id=30311&template=dlfcup">40th ODI Century</a>Â  the first batsman ever to achieve this feat.
