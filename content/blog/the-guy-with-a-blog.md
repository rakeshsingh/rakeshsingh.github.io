<a href="http://kunal.wordpress.com">Kunal </a>pings me and points me out that <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2006/09/09/song-kya-mujhe-pyaar-hai-woh-lamhe/">one of my posts </a>is in top 10 posts of <a href="http://botd.wordpress.com/top-posts/">wordpress </a>today and also I am at #67 at <a href="http://botd.wordpress.com/">top blogs.</a>  It sure feels good to be  in the front row of a community which has over 3 million proud bloggers in it.

Looking back I see that there was a time when I considered it to be an achievement when <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2005/01/24/my-visitor-count-is-200-now/">my visitor count reached to 200</a> :) and now the above mentioned post of mine itself has a count  of some 2000 odd visitors. The other post containing the lyrics of <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2006/08/09/lyricspal-pal-har-pal-lage-raho-munna-bhai/">"Pal Pal song from Munnabhai"</a> is also doing reasonably well and consistently attracting on an average 200 visitors every day. The daily visitor count of this blog has averaged close to 700 with a peak of 961 visitors.

<a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2006/08/24/when-is-web-20-releasing/">My post on Web2.0</a> got <a href="http://www.desipundit.com/2006/08/27/when-is-web-20-releasing/">Desipundited</a> and the other <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2006/08/10/technorati-tags-bookmarklet-version-03/">post about Technorati Tagbookmarklet</a> too has done quiet a good job by earning me several inlinks especially the one from <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/08/11/an-alternative-version-of-the-popular-technorati-tagging-bookmarklet-available/">Lorelle</a>.

On the personal side as well, I am slowly and steadily getting known as <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2006/09/20/the-guy-with-a-blog/"><em>the guy with a blog</em></a>. Some time back we went for Kuntala falls trip and I made a <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2006/07/31/trip-to-kuntala-falls/">blog entry</a> about it. Last week one of my team mates came smiling to me saying that he has seen my blog while searching for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=trip+kuntala+falls&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">Kuntala Falls in Google</a>. Similary my childhood friends found my blog while searching for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=9ue&hl=en&lr=&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&q=rakesh+palojori&btnG=Search">my name and Palojori.</a> Once Bhaiya called me to let me know that he had forgotten the link of my blog but he too was able to locate it by googling for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=panchagani+trip+photo&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">"panchagani trip photo".</a>

So far so good, lets see how long will I be able to carry this passion of blogging without affecting my professional life.

Update: Daily visiit of this blog has peaked to more than 1k now.
