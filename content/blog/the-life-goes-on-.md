Yesterday, I saw something which I didnt expect to see, especially in an IT industry its a rare phenomenon.  There was this guy, switching job from oracle to somewhere else. Yesterday was his last day in Office and I could see   that it was really hard for him to part from his collegues.   Contrary to the industry behavior, where people hardly care to say that they are leaving, he went to everyone's desk,   shook hands and said good bye, giving everyone his Yahoo!! id and asking to be in touch.    Before yesterday, he was just "some QA person" , but for now on I'll never forget his name.   Gopal, wish you all the best for your future endeavours. I wish you had spent some more time with us.<br /> --  ‹^› ‹(•¿•)› ‹^›
