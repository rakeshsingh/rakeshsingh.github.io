Young Boy: Le lijiye na saab. Me: Are nahi lena bhai.. Kisi aur se poocho jake !!  Young Boy: Sir, Subah se ek bhi nahi bika, Sir, ek to le lijiye na. Plzz. Me: [feeling sorry for the poor guy] Chal yaar, la de, 2 Cornetto dena.. [handed over the money to him].. but layega kahan se .. tere pas to kuch dikhta nahi !!  Young Boy: Sir, samne jo stall hai udhar se .. Me: Ok, Jaldi lana .. mujhe jana hai..   Young Boy: Bas 1 minute sir...  well the rest U can understand .. that one minute never came ...
