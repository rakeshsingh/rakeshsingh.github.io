It wasnt a good beginning at all, as I wasnt able to go home becasue of the work, something which I was desperately looking for .. but as they say <font>If the end be well, all will be well</font>.  And It ended pretty well.. Even though I was knee deep in the work, I thoroughly enjoyed the week.

It was my first holi out of <a href="http://www.iiit.net">campus</a> and contrary to <a href="http://beerla.blogspot.com/2006/03/holi.html">many</a> of <a href="http://kunal.wordpress.com/2006/03/15/colourless-holi/">my friends</a>, I played holi with the same enthusiasm and vigour with which I used to play in College. This time we didnt have a holiday on Holi in my company, but thanks to my team mates Ajay, <a href="http://amitxlnc.multiply.com">Amit</a> and manager<a href="http://www.satpathy.in/blog/gautamsatpathy/index.html"> Gautam</a>, we never felt the need of a holiday.

We planned to celebrate the holi and then come back to office and thats what we did. So, on the Holi day, I was totally covered in colors even before my room mates were awake. Thanks again to the three Aces (read Ajay, Amit and  Asheesh) to plan it thoroughly.

<a href="http://frustooo.blogspot.com/"> Amal </a>was back in the hyderabad  for the week ends and so were <a href="http://adityamaheshwari.blogspot.com/">Adi</a> and <a href="http://students.iiit.ac.in/~piyush_j">Piyush</a>. Spent some time with them. It always feels good doing nothing but plain BC [its not that famous BC of BC Sutta song ;)] with friends.

Wanted to spend some more time with them, but wasnt able to do so; all  courtesy to the stomach ache caused by regular trips of Nihaal Dhaba and the last few days of the week were mostly spent in watching movies.

Watched RDB once again, then Parineeta and GodZilla, The Core, The Crash, The Thirteenth Warrior... Parineeta is an awsome movie .. how could I miss it earlier :( and Vidya Balan is.. just so ..

My favorite list +=Vidya Balan :)
Its monday again, I am back in office and supposed to work :) . Just wishing this week also goes equally well.
