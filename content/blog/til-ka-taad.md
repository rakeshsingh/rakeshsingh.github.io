Till Yesterday, <em>Aaj Tak</em> and several other news channels in India were predicting the<a href="http://lhc-first-beam.web.cern.ch/lhc-first-beam/Welcome.html"> LHC Experiment</a> will cause the absolute destruction which will cause the "End Of The World".

How bullshit, can any news be. Why can't these news channels try to simplify the technical things and help the common man understand, what an important scientific experiment it is,<a href="http://microcosm.web.cern.ch/microcosm/LHCGame/LHCGame.html"> like this game</a> does.

People, in rural areas of India have actually panicked after hearing this news on news channel. Yesterday I got calls from my dad and my father in law, both saying that several people in their area have taken leaves and gone home to stay with their beloved ones, just in case if its the end of world, they can DIE together.

Isn't there something called responsibility, which Indian news channels have forgotten about. And when the whole world is fighting against terrorism, what is this that these news channels are doing.

Spreading Terror, in disguise of a Breaking News.

Someone should sue these TV channels.
