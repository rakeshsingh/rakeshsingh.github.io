<blockquote>Lakdi ki Kathi, Kathi Pe Ghoda, Ghode ki dum pe jo mara hathoda</blockquote>
I grew up listening to this beautiful innocent song from the movie Masoom and used to think that this is just another movie made for kids, never thought to give it a see untill I listened to the song..
<blockquote>Tujhse Naraj Nahi Zindagi, Hairan Hoon Main
Tere Masoom Sawalon se, Pareshan hoon Main</blockquote>
The only word that comes to my mind after seeing this is brilliance, sheer brilliance; of everyone.. all the actors especially the kid Yougal Hansraj and the Director.. Well it was all so real and convincing that for a fraction of time I paused the movie and  put myself in Naseer's position and tried to analyze the situation. What could I have done in that situation or anyone for that matter.

Life is such a thing that at times it takes us to  a point where no matter what we think or try to do, we are left helpless, only with a hope that may be someday everything will become alright; well till then its only suffering...

[PS: The mp3 of the song Tujhse Naraaz Nahi can be found <a href="http://kumar.rakesh.googlepages.com/TujhSayNaraazNahinZindage.mp3">here</a>.]
