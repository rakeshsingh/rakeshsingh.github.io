1. Got Second Salary of My first job :) 

2. The so called honeymoon period in oracle is over and now its a complete new world full of BUGs

3. Recovered from a viral. It was a different experience .. for the last 4 yrs 
I had almost forgotten what a fever is and had started feeling like unbreakable ... seems the life after campus is full of various kind of challenges...

4. Finally, got a chance to listen to Oracle's 11 Billion $ man. <img src="http://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressroom/html/pressportal/exec/jwookey.jpg" alt="john wookey" align="right"/> 

He is the man behind the deals like Peoplesoft, JD Edward, Retek, iFlex etc.

5. Had a nice time at IDC Opening ceremony. It was kewl .. the cultural events were just too good .. short duration, lesser in number but of remarkable quality... I remeber in college listening to Rock Band meant .. listening to one song .. Check .. Check Check .. ... thankfully it was not
the case here ... it was a nice Fusion show .. the other attraction were fashion show, dance numbers, singing a song with words reveresed [Well, first time saw a public performance of something which I used to think, is a copyrighted property of mine]. But the thing which stole the show was developer song.. well composed and well
performed .. Even though its composed keeping only Oracle employees in mind ..
others can also enjoy it <a href="http://students.iiit.ac.in/~rakesh_kumar/developer.mp3">here .. </a>

well.. thats it for now .. brb soon
