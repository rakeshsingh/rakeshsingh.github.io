<a href="http://utkarshkhare.wordpress.com/">Utkarsh</a> pinged me and asked to see this blog <a href="http://creatorraja.blogspot.com/">http://creatorraja.blogspot.com/</a> and I must say
that the very first glance on it surprised me like anything.

<a href="http://creatorraja.blogspot.com/2006/10/god-is-back.html">The post which I saw</a> first had Sachin Tendulkar, waving his bat to audience after reaching his 40th ODI century. Isn't this post familiar ! Hell ! It is, and not just familiar; its a copy of my post <a href="http://rakesh.in/2006/09/14/the-god-is-back/">"The God is Back".</a>

I looked again and found that not only this post .. but all the post on that blog are lifted as it is from my blog (Post content & Title everything is as it is) and without any attribution !! This guy (I am assuming it to guy) is copying my posts for last 4 months and I never noticed it.

Another post screenshot:

Its funny that while copy pasting, the guy posted one such article where he talks him to be a wordpress user :)

Not sure, how to tackle this issue. As of now, I have just dropped him a comment asking to remove my posts or at least give proper links to my blog.

Lets see what is his reaction.

Update: The content thief, has deleted his blog now. <a href="http://mindwarrior.wordpress.com/2006/11/07/plagiarist-rajacreatorraja/">Thanks </a>to <a href="http://marutiborker.wordpress.com/2006/11/07/another-victim-of-plagarism">everyone </a>for support.
