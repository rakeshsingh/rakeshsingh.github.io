Basically the BC-baazs in pure IIIT lingo <img src="http://students.iiit.net/~rakesh_kumar/images/wink.gif"/> well a whole bunch of them got 
together last night. It all started from the lab, from where Me and Majj 
left for the hostel...somehow we ended up in Vidit's room. Actually Majj
went there to get some oranges as he was hungry like anything <img src="http://students.iiit.net/~rakesh_kumar/images/smile.gif"/>

The proper BC started at this place only... where we movied from Prof
Jhunjhunwala to Premchand then to Mahadevi Varma then talked some time about
Hindi Literature the "Chhayawadi" Poets ... then to schools then education.. 
and quality of education.. quality of life... lifestyle... language... well!
a series of interconnected topics..

Well the scene got little changed with the arrival of Pelu and Ramneek and 
Parivesh... and now the topic was a hot favorite of we IIITians, about
Linux and Windows.. the Free software and the properietary software ....

Well, I silenty watched this discussion...  I am tired of this topic...
People here can't understand that both of these things have their equal impor
-tance and in the absense of one the  other will lose its glitter... Both 
learn from each other to improvise over themselves... but certainly there 
will remain some conceptual differences...

I personally like,use Linux  and advocate it but only for the community to 
which I belong...i.e Computer Engineers... Linux gives us the playground to
show our creativity and curiousity... On the other hand Windows serves 
entirely diffent purpose... 

I have always looked it as an OS made for Old Men, Children, Housewives and 
novices like them... It really works good for their purpose... A beautiful 
GUI... Lots of functionalities... makes lay users feel as if they are a kid
in a Magic shop. 

The basic difference is what me and Majj discussed later in the night about
movies and the concept of masses and classes... which is very clearly visible
in the showbiz... we see movies of two types .. one of them is of the type of 
David Dhawan Comedies... the Govindaa Chaap Movies... meant for masses ...
and the others which fall in the likes of Black... meant for the classes. 
Person who understand and appreciate the talent,the work, the perfection, 
the beauty. Basically the persons who are qualified enough to appreciate 
these movies...

I feel in our industry Windows represents the Masses and Linux represents US.


As far as OpenSource and Free Softwares are concerned, they come under an 
entirely differnt and noble philosophy. A concept very close to the heart 
of us.

Well won't stretch much on this topic. The only thing that I would like to
say is that we already see lots of wars going in the world... Peoples have
shed their blood for Zehads... Don't make our industry another warfield...

We always have the example of India ... Unity in diversity... Sarva Dharma
Samabhava... 

Lets learn from the same old Indian philosophy..

Lets install the vmware or vnc viewer and enjoy  best of both of the worlds...<img src="http://students.iiit.net/~rakesh_kumar/images/smile.gif"/>
