The ICC World cup is here again, and back is that madness towards this sport. Everyone around me is crazy about Cricket and doing their best not to miss any of the matches. I being a die hard cricket fan from heart (though I rarely admit that) am among those as well.

We, bought this new television set and the Tata Sky connection just for this world cup. But the very first match and I see its better to avoid (if one could) these matches. The problem is that however hard we try we cant help but to attach ourselves emotionally with this game, and there lies the problem.

India in its very first match succumbs in front of a so called "Minnow" Bangladesh, which actually turns out to be a Shark; and the emotional level comes down to such a low, that it starts showing in your behavior. For example, I turn into all sorts of superstitions, (don't change your current sitting position, dont say a bad thing about India), another good friend gets so much tensed that you just need to push him a little and he will break into tears (he actually cried after last world cup final), and another friends starts doing all sort of Numeric calculations (Isn't Saturday too close to Friday !! Which in a way gives advantage to Bangladesh !!!)

So much and for what, those Sehwags (who feel a its virtue to give away their wickets as if you are contributing to a charity, damn ! if you cant play just accept that fact and leave the place for others)Â  or Dhonis (Going at a duck, Che !! how could you when a Patel hits a couple of boundaries :( ).

One of my teachers used to say, don't get this "Kirkit", thing go into your blood, its always going to end up in in some sort of frustration. Damn ! How true he was and I just hope that he would have said this a little earlier.
