<p>Well, its close to 4 AM and I am working on an assignment... really surprizing because I hardly put so much effort into studies... but its different this time...</p>
<p>... probably I am going through a phase where everyone thinks like this or its the effect of Dr.<br />
Anindita Mukhopadhyay that I am taking some things very seriously and really thinking over them.<br />
and thats why this assignment, which is just a step towards my self making... its about Nationalism and how it is shown in Indian movies.. we had to pick one movie of our choice and analyze it in that context...</p>
<p>..I chose Swades... why ?? its again part of the question... right now the only thing<br />
that I can say that this movie made me think on things which I know but never really gave<br />
much thought...</p>
<p>Well, just a little bit about this movie :</p>
<p>Starting with this excerpt of the conversation between Mohan Bhargava and the villagers.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><font color="green"><br />
"mujhe nahi lagta hamara desh duniya ka sabse mahaan desh hai<br />
lekin yeh zaroor manta hoon ham me takat hai kabiliyat hai is<br />
desh ko mahan banane ki"<br />
</font><br />
</p>
<p>The way we portray our patriotism in hindi films till now is like blaming others for our failures. Why is being progressive and understanding and going after dreams beyond just love stories with heroines, considered a taboo. Why dont we get real? I think coz we are afraid<br />
of it. I find culture and respect for elders and everything that is served to us with<br />
meaningless overacting is trash. I dont denounce our values. I respect it very much, but lets stop making it a shield to hide our insecurities.<br />
What we need is simple real and brilliant vision of Mohan Barghava. We need sensitivity and love.. See Mohan Bhargav, listen to his silence in the train, see his pain in the farmer's<br />
house, his passion when working on the dam, his patience when he goes to villagers for educating their children,his love when he gathers the children in the song(Yeh tara woh Tara..).</p>
<p>Its not just important to see this movie but understand its motive. To go out feel like Mohan. Connect to people to be real. dont be over emotional, be practical, be natural. Love ur work. Know your responsibilities and don't runaway from it; act on it. Can we all do that. Everybody has to play a part to make this happen. Ashutosh has done his bit, its now for us to make his effort worthwhile. There are many problems, corruption, poverty, deplorable poltics and over population. But are these problems a way of justifying our heartless mindless behaviour, our indifference. the way we always blame the system, why dont we for a change do something. something without malice, without expectations, without our insecurties. purely folowing our instincts of the good, being rational all the way.</p>
<p>I will just quote a line from a song of the movie......<br />
<b><br />
<font color="green"><br />
"tu na pooch raste mein ka hai,<br />
aayen hai jo is tarah do rahe,<br />
tu hi to hai rah jo sujhaye,<br />
tu hi to hai jo ab bataye<br />
jaye to kis disha mein jaye wahi des..."</font></b></p>
