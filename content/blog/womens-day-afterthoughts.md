<p>Ever wondered why they dont celebrate Men's Day with that fan fare[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Men%27s_Day">except in Trinidad and Tobago</a>]  </p>
<p>Unless a man is a Father or a brother or a husband, there is no day exclusively reserved for him :( ... its too bad feeling less privileged :( </p>

<p>Well, just to make me happy, there is this another thought, which is probably more closer to the truth, that  people just created this women's day to please women, cause we all know that its going to be a man's day, be its women's day or any other day.
</p>

<p>After all its a men's world.</p>
