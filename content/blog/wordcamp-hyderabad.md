I was checking this article by matt on <a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/07/11/wordcamp-san-francisco/">Wordcamp San Francisco</a>, and I was wondering whether we can have one in hyderabad.

A simple google search of <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=site%3A*.wordpress.com+%2B+hyderabad&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">"site:*.wordpress.com + hyderabad"</a> returns  close to 90,000 results and assuming 100 posts per user in this category the user count comes to 900.

That means there are almost 1000 of us wordpress users in and around hyderabad.

Imagine an evening in a coffee shop with all of you guys .. It will be really cool.

But, its a vague idea, someday I will sit down and plan how to materialize it.  As of now I am going to Pune to attend the <a href="http://punehackathon.pbwiki.com/">Pune Rails Hackathon.</a>
