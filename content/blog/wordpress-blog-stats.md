Cool utility provided by wordpress, am going through it since last half an hour or so ...

shows a nice graph of number of visitors to my blog along with many other things, including top referrers, top posts ...

but the best thing is the search queries which lead to my blog ...

some of the funny  queries:

<strong>Airtel Nigahein
tujhse naraz nahi
airtel dil ki baat </strong>

and the best one

<strong>"Kunal Murder" Song</strong>

Bach ke rahna kunal, there is some psycho after you, who wants to sing a song after killing you :)
