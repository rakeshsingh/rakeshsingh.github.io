The official page is <a href="http://messenger.yahoo.com/partners_msn.php">here</a> .

I was wondering what could be the reasons for it.

Has gTalk become so popular that its now a threat to Yahoo Messenger ? I dont think so.

I think its the voice chat segment mainly, where the growing popularity of gTalk has made Yahoo and MSN a little more cautious and forced to shake hands.

Well, good for end users, we will have more options, if not better.
