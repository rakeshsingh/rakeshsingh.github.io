Today I was in a mood to go to some theatre and watch a movie. Its not that I haven't seen any movie lately. I did see <em>Dor </em>and <em>Shiva</em>, but both on PC (thanks to these torrent sites).  <em>Dor </em>is a very beautiful movie, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. But the effect that <em>Dor </em>created soon got destroyed after watching <em>Shiva</em>. One word, Pathetic describes the movie in its fullest. I wonder why Ramgopal Verma is wasting his (?) money on such crappy movies.

Anyway, I decided to go for <em>Khosla Ka Ghoshla</em>, but wasn't able to book the tickets for the same. So when Pusham told me that the tickets for Woh Lamhe are available I  agreed for it. Though initially I wasnt really in the mood to go for this movie but when <a href="http://mindwarrior.wordpress.com/2006/10/02/lappies-buddies/">Kopos vouched for it</a> I thought that I should better pay some tribute to the movie which has earned me so many visitors with the <a href="http://rakeshkumar.wordpress.com/2006/09/09/song-kya-mujhe-pyaar-hai-woh-lamhe/">"Kyun Aaj Kal"</a> post.

Well, I must say that the movie is very good , even though at times I felt that the Schizophrenia scenes were highly inspired with the movie "<em>A beautiful Mind</em>" and were overdone at places and that girl <em>Rani</em>, looked as if she has been just taken  out from the movie <em>Bhoot </em>and put here. But despite all these the movie is very well made. <em>Shiney </em>shines as usually and <em>Kangana </em>too has maintained the <em>Khanak</em> which she showed in  <em>Gangster. </em>And, the best thing of the movie is its songs. Just too Good.

Thats all about the movie , I am already late for a complete review and not too keen to write one here. But, there is something else that happened in the theatre about which I am going to write here.

There were three of us for the movie, Me, Pushpam and Parivesh. Pushpam was sitting in the middle and me and Parivesh by each of his sides. There was a [not so] gentleman sitting in my right side seat and as it happens, our seat had a common armrest.

It was all fine in the beginning. But as soon as the lights were dimmed down and the movie started. I felt that this guy has started taking too much of the available space between us. And soon his hands started touching my hands. Considering it a normal situation I lifted my hand off the armrest and let him have the complete armrest, I also politely pointed him about the situation. He folded his bands back. Some 5 minutes spent and and his hands were back again. This time I was engrossed in the movie and didn't pay heed to it. But, soon I noticed that his hands have  crossed the armrest and are now touching my thighs now.

This really made me furious. I couldnt tolerate it any more and scolded him for not sitting properly and told him to behave himslef. Looking at the tone in my voice he immediately changed his posture and sat upright.

I had made up in mind, if he repeats the same thing again I am gonna slap him hard on the face.   Bloody Gays !! But somehow, he seemed a little wiser and didnt repeat his mistake. He sat properly for the remaining part of the first half and post interval swapped the seat with his friend.

Now, I am still not sure that that guy was actually a gay or not. May be it was just a carelessness from his side.  But still I think its better to speak out whenever you have a even a slightest of  doubt.

Kyuni ! KantaBen kah ke gayi hai :) ki,  Kuch bhi ho sakta hai bhaiya, zamana kharab hai
